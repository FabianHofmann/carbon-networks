		Thank you for the opportunity to submit our manuscript to Nature Energy. Hereby we submit the paper “\hydrogen{} and \carbon{} Network Strategies for the European Energy System”.

		In our study, we introduce the first large-scale investment model that assesses the co-benefits of a carbon-dioxide and a hydrogen transport system in Europe. The model optimizes the production, transport, and storage of various carriers, including electricity, hydrogen, methane, and carbon-dioxide, across all relevant sectors.

		The paper appears at an important time, with policy makers and industry leaders concretizing plans and investments for hydrogen and carbon-dioxide management systems. In particular, it remains unclear how and to what extent synthetic fuel production and permanent carbon storage (carbon sequestration) should be integrated into the future energy system.

		Our analysis not only confirms the crucial flexibility that \hydrogen{} and \carbon{} transport systems bring to \carbon{} emission neutral energy systems, but also illustrates how their combination further enhances energy efficiency and social welfare. We show that the hydrogen grid optimally transports low-cost hydrogen from areas with good renewable resources to regionally-distributed carbon sources such as industrial clusters and biomass combustion plants to enable synthetic fuel production at site. A carbon-dioxide network, on the other hand, is most cost-beneficial to transport low-cost carbon from point sources near the coast to sequestration sites to permanently store it. In such a setup, the system unlocks most carbon capture potentials from biomass and reduces the reliance on cost-intensive direct air capture. Moreover, the benefits of deploying both networks increase when enforcing a net carbon-removal target, leading to system-cost reductions of 6 billion Euros per year.

		Our analysis underlines the importance of incorporating hydrogen and carbon dioxide networks into European energy policy for a resilient, carbon-neutral or negative future energy system.

		We did not have any prior discussions with a Nature Energy editor about this manuscript. The manuscript has not been published and is not under consideration for publication elsewhere.

		We believe that our findings are in line with the scope of Nature Energy and will be of interest to your readership. We want to thank the editor for taking the time to consider the publication of our paper in Nature Energy.
