\begin{abstract}
    The transition to a carbon-neutral European economy is a pressing challenge that demands coordinated action across various energy sectors, particularly in emissions-intensive industries like heavy manufacturing. While management of both \hydrogen{} and \carbon{} is considered a critical component of this transition, a gap exists in understanding how new hydrogen infrastructures effectively interact with comprehensive carbon management technologies, including carbon capture, transport, use, and storage. In particular, the role of a carbon transport network as a complementing or substituting infrastructure to hydrogen transport remains unclear. To address this gap, our study employs optimization techniques to design the first cost-optimal European energy system that fully incorporates carbon management technologies, hydrogen transport and storage, and renewable energy sources with a high spatial and temporal resolution considering all energy intensive sectors.
    Our findings reveal that in a either-or scenario, the hydrogen network is superior to the carbon network as it enables the transportation cheap hydrogen inland to serve industrial processes and carbon capture and utilization at point sources. A carbon network facilitates point-source carbon capture and reduces the need for direct air capture, but leaves the scarcity of hydrogen in energy-intensive regions such as industrial clusters.
    However, in a hybrid scenario, the carbon network is a cost-effective complement to the hydrogen network facilitating carbon capture at point sources and transport to sequestration sites.
    We show that theses findings holds true against the backdrop of a net-zero energy system, as well as scenarios where the net-negative emissions are 5\% and 10\% lower than the 1990 baseline levels.
    Overall, our work demonstrates the cost-effectiveness of a multi-grid system that includes both hydrogen and carbon transport networks and power grid expansion to achieve climate neutrality in Europe.
    The paper underpins the need for a complementing hydrogen network and \carbon{} network to achieve climate neutrality.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}


An integrated management of both hydrogen and carbon is considered a crucial component to achieve climate neutrality in energy systems including hard-to-abate sectors. Hydrogen offers an efficient way to transport and store energy from different sources. Carbon, on the other hand, can be effectively captured from industrial processes and the combustion of both fossil and synthetic fuels through Carbon Capture (CC) techniques or harvested directly from the atmosphere using Direct-Air Capture (DAC). Additionally, it can be stored in geological formations, a process known as carbon sequestration or carbon capture and storage (CCS). In combination, both together build the basis for climate-neutral fuels like methane, methanol or Fischer-Tropsch fuels, central to Power-to-X (PtX) and Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU) strategies.

Recently, policymakers and industry in Europe have been committing to both hydrogen and carbon management projects, planning infrastructure components, and developing business models for emerging sectors of the economy. With the European Union's goal of achieving climate neutrality by 2050, a wide range of programs, funding models and initiatives have been established in this regard~\cite{eu2023netzero,europeangreendeal,europeaninnovationfund}. Initiatives like the European Hydrogen Backbone~\cite{gasforclimateEuropeanHydrogenBackbone2022} or the Hydrogen infrastructure Map~\cite{H2InfrastructureMap} showcase the potential of hydrogen as a fuel and energy carrier. At the same time, business models from companies like Tree Energy Solutions~\cite{TESHydrogenLife2023}, Carbfix~\cite{WeTurnCO2}, and Equinor~\cite{adomaitisEquinorRWEBuild2023} advertise carbon management hubs that provide green hydrogen, methane, or synfuels on the one hand and offer \carbon{} offtake on the other hand. For Europe, the Capture Map~\cite{ToolsGreenTransition} estimates a potential of 1.4~Gt of carbon capture from point sources per year. In combination with large sequestration potentials as stated in~\cite{weiProposedGlobalLayout2021}, this highlights the vast potential for decarbonization. The Northern Lights project in Norway~\cite{NorthernLightsWhat} is planning with a 1.5 Mt/a co2 transport and sequestration capacity to be operating in 2024, expanding to a targeted scale of 5 Mt/a sequestration by 2030.
To this end, the Clean Air Task Force underlines the importance of a carbon transport system in Europe to facilitate the carbon economy~\cite{lockwoodEuropeanStrategyCarbon}.


However, up to this point, it remains unclear how the two management systems of hydrogen and carbon may complement or replace each other, particularly when it comes to their transport systems. A hydrogen network facilitates the transport of energy from renewable sources to regions with high energy demand, also enabling Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU) from specific point sources. On the other hand, the carbon transport system allows for capturing and transporting carbon from areas with high emissions to regions with significant sequestration potential and abundant renewable sources, thereby enabling cost-effective CCU.
In the literature, the two network approaches and underlying technologies have been discussed in a number of publications, all of which, however, dealt with the isolated effects~\cite{bakkenLinearModelsOptimization2008,morbeeOptimisedDeploymentEuropean2012,stewartFeasibilityEuropeanwideIntegrated2014,oeiModelingCarbonCapture2014,elahiMultiperiodLeastCost2014,burandtDecarbonizingChinaEnergy2019,middletonSimCCSOpensourceTool2020,bjerketvedtOptimalDesignCost2020,weiProposedGlobalLayout2021,damoreOptimalDesignEuropean2021,becattiniCarbonDioxideCapture2022}. In contrast to Integrated Assessment Models, the underlying optimization tools account for the spatial distribution of carbon sources and sinks which are crucial provide a holistic view of the energy system and its technological interactions.. The work in~\cite{neumannBenefitsHydrogenNetwork2022} examines the effect of a hydrogen network in Europe... (extend on hydrogen literature)
The publication by Morbee et al.~\cite{morbeeOptimisedDeploymentEuropean2012} optimizes the topology and capacity of a \carbon{} network in Europe, but only considers the power sector without co-optimizing renewable deployment.
Another comprehensive example is found in~\cite{becattiniCarbonDioxideCapture2022}, which presents a mixed-integer model to optimize the time-evolution of a \carbon{} transport system in Switzerland, connecting to a remote sequestration site in Norway. To this end, it is often argued that \carbon{} pipelines are a mature technology with an expected high learning rate, given the wide-spread installations in US and Canada for enhanced oil recovery~\cite{righettiSitingCarbonDioxide2017,friedmannNETZEROGEOSPHERICRETURN}.
% However, the models are often limited with regard to both geographical scope and detail. While representing a single country with spatial resolution may neglect synergies of international cooperation, a coarse grained representation of multiple countries may neglect important geographical properties.

To our knowledge, no study has yet considered the co-optimization and comprehensive assessment of both \hydrogen{} and \carbon{} networks in a fully sector-coupled energy system. However, we argue that such an assessment is strongly needed to avoid suboptimal investments and to identify synergies between hydrogen and carbon management technologies. In this paper, we present a detailed study of the European energy system for 2050, which includes high geographical resolution and a comprehensive representation of carbon management technologies. The study is conducted using the PyPSA-Eur energy system model and encompasses all relevant energy sectors. We enable the system to optimize the design of renewable energy sources and storage technologies, as well as the transmission of electricity, \hydrogen{}, methane, and \carbon{}. We show that the dynamics of carbon capture, transport, use, and storage in different regions are highly dependent on the availability of renewable energy, \carbon{} pipelines and sequestration sinks. Our evaluation focuses on the transport dynamics of \carbon{} and \hydrogen{} through their respective networks on the European continent. We also analyze how an energy system with limited annual sequestration potential prioritizes decarbonization and fuel switching in various sectors, and how the construction of carbon networks varies based on different levels of available sequestration potential.


\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}

The study is conducted on the basis of the open-source, capacity-expansion model PyPSA-Eur~\cite{horschPyPSAEurOpenOptimisation2018,brownSynergiesSectorCoupling2018,PyPSAEurSecSectorCoupledOpen2023}.
The model optimizes the design and operation of the European energy system, encompassing the power, heat, industry, waste, and transport sectors.

\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{baseline/figures/90_nodes/total-demand-bar.png}
    \caption{Exogenous demand assumptions. The figure shows the total amount of yearly energy demands for each energy carrier and type of end-consumer considered in the model.}
    \label{fig:total-demand-bar}
\end{figure}
%
In our configuration, the model's time horizon spans one year with a temporal resolution of 3 hours and a spatial resolution of 90 regions. Each of the regions consists of a complex subsystem with technologies for supplying, converting, storing and transporting energy. Exogenous assumptions on energy demand and non-abatable emissions are taken from various sources~\cite{piamanzGeoreferencedIndustrialSites2018,muehlenpfordtTimeSeries2019,mantzosJRCIDEES20152018,NationalEmissionsReported2023,EurostatCompleteEnergyBalance,uwekrienDemandlib2023}. The energy demand for electricity, transport, biomass, heat and gas are defined per region and time-step with heat demand being regionally subdivided into shares of urban, rural and industrial sites. Demands for aviation kerosene, methanol for shipping and naphtha for industry are aggregated in the system scope and kept constant throughout all time-steps. We show the sum of all energy demands in \ref{fig:total-demand-bar}. The system emits of 633~Mt \carbon{} per year through non-abatable emissions from industry, aviation, shipping and agriculture into account, 153~Mt of which are fossil-based industrial emissions. Industrial energy demand and excess heat potentials are calculated per node on the basis of~\cite{hotmaps_industrial_db}.

%
Endogenous assumptions include the expansion of renewable energy sources, storage technologies, and transmission capacities.
The model considers the various energy carriers like electricity, hydrogen, methan, methanol, liquid hydrocarbons and biomass, together with conversions technologies to convert these into each other.
Carbon-neutral electricity is provided by wind, solar, biomass, hydro and nuclear power plants. Weather-dependent power potentials for solar, wind and hydro are calculated from reanalysis and satellite data sets~\cite{hersbachERA5GlobalReanalysis2020,pfeifrothSurfaceRadiationData2017}  per region and time-stamp, using the open-source tool Atlite~\cite{hofmannAtliteLightweightPython2021}.
Solar and wind power can be expanded in alignment with eligible land-use restrictions calculated on the basis of~\cite{eeaCorineLandCover2012,eeaNatura2000Data2016}. We restrict the electric transmission system's expansion to 20\% of its current capacity, acknowledging the challenges in inaugurating new transmission projects.
The regional use of biomass is restricted by its feasible potential derived from~\cite{enspreso_database,instituteforenergyandtransportjointresearchcentreJRCEUTIMESModelBioenergy2015}. Inter-regional biomass transport is permitted with transport costs considered.

Hydrogen can be gained from electrolysis and steam methane reforming (SMR). Geological distribution and potentials for \hydrogen storage in salt caverns are derived from~\cite{caglayanTechnicalPotentialSalt2020}. Re-electrification of hydrogen is possible via fuel cells. If enabled, hydrogen can be transported via pipelines between regions which can be expanded without limit. The topology of the \hydrogen network is mirroring the topology of the electricity network.

Carbon capture (CC) technologies consist of a range of augmented technologies with integrated carbon capture. These include Allam Cycle Power Plants, Gas Combined Heat and Power Plant (CHP), Steam Methan Reforming (SMR), Direc-Air Capture (DAC), biomass combustion, biogas combustion and capture of process emissions from industry.

Our model features three drop-in fuel production technologies for carbon utilization: methanation, methanolization, and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. The processed fuels are not limited in their total quantity of use or production. Methane is transported through the gas network, while methanol and FT-synfuel can be transferred inter-regionally without additional costs. Synthetic methane substitutes natural gas or biogas, serving combined heat and power plants, residential heating gas boilers, or industrial gas needs. Synthetic methanol decarbonizes marine industry fuel demands, and FT fuels replace fossil oil for naphtha production, aviation kerosene, or agricultural machinery oil.
We only consider offshore sites as potential sinks for carbon sequestration. This choice favors offshore storage due to its typically larger capacity compared to onshore and concerns over public safety for infrastructure near populated areas. Our estimates for storage potential are conservative, limiting total potential to 25~Mt per site, calculating annual storage availability over 25 years, and capping the total sequestered \carbon{} to 200~Mt/a. All technology cost assumptions for 2040 are sourced from an open-source database~\cite{lisazeyenPyPSATechnologydataTechnology2023}.


Addressing climate targets, we define three \carbon{} target scenarios:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[] \textit{Net-Zero}: aligning with the EU's 2050 emission targets. Also denoted as NZ.
    \item[] \textit{Net-Negative~5\%}: relative to 1990 emissions, equaling 230~Mt \carbon{}. Also denoted as NN~5\%.
    \item[] \textit{Net-Negative~10\%}: relative to 1990 emissions, equaling 460~Mt \carbon. Also denoted as NN~10\%.
\end{itemize}
Unless otherwise mentioned, our reference is the Net-zero scenario. For 5\% Net-negative and 10\% Net-negative scenarios, the carbon sequestration potential is adjusted to 400~Mt/a and 600~Mt/a, respectively.

Beyond \carbon{} targets, we consider four expansion scenarios:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[] \textit{Baseline:} Neither \carbon{} nor \hydrogen{} networks are constructed.
    \item[] \textit{\hydrogen{}-Net:} Only the \hydrogen{} network is developed.
    \item[] \textit{\carbon{}-Net:} Only the \carbon{} network is developed.
    \item[] \textit{Hybrid:} Both \carbon{} and \hydrogen{} networks are developed.
\end{itemize}



\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}


The comprehensive analysis of the European energy system scenarios in 2050 highlights significant variations in system costs and technology deployment across the different network strategies, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:cost_bar}. The system cost decomposition for the Baseline, CO2-Net, H2-Net, and Hybrid scenarios are visualized as stacked bar plots, facilitating an insightful comparison of the economic implications of each scenario.

"Carbon Capture at Point Sources" combines all technologies with integrated carbon capture.}
    \label{fig:cost_bar}
\end{figure}

In the Baseline scenario, the absence of dedicated hydrogen and carbon networks necessitates a heavy reliance on local renewable generation and storage solutions, reflected in the substantial investments in solar and wind capacities.
The cost of carbon removal technologies, CC and DAC, also forms a significant portion of the overall expenses. However, this scenario's limitations are apparent, as the lack of transport networks for hydrogen and carbon leads to higher system costs due to inefficiencies and lost opportunities for optimization.


Transitioning to the CO2-Net scenario, we observe a significant cost reduction and a shift in cost allocation.
The implementation of a \carbon{} transport network (\textit{\carbon{}-Net}) facilitates efficient point-source carbon capture, substantially reducing the dependency on direct air capture (DAC) technologies. The improved carbon management infrastructure also allows for a more strategic deployment of renewables, particularly in areas with high sequestration potential, leading to cost savings in renewable generation and storage.

The H2-Net scenario underscores the pivotal role of hydrogen infrastructure. The creation of a hydrogen transport network enables the cost-effective delivery of hydrogen from regions with a surplus of cheap renewable energy to high-demand industrial centers. This scenario shows a pronounced decrease in investments in solar and gas  infrastructure.

While the cost-reduction in the Hybrid scenario compared to the \hydrogen-Net scenario is marginal, the allocation of costs reveals a propagation of reduced DAC facilities and increased CC at point sources. The Hybrid scenario relies much heavier on investments into the \hydrogen network which outweigh investments in the \carbon{} network by a factor 4.

With the cost reduction across the different system setups, the utilization of carbon capture technologies varies significantly, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:captureshare_line}. This variation highlights how the implementation of \hydrogen{} and \carbon{} networks unlocks specific carbon capture potentials.

\end{figure}



First, we analyze the optimal deployment of technologies and their associated costs at different levels of carbon sequestration potential. Figure~\ref{fig:cost_area} displays the annual system cost per technology group for the sector-coupled model at various sequestration levels, both with and without a \carbon{} network. The costs are calculated as the sum of the annualized investment and operational costs for all technologies. Starting from the left, we observe that the majority of system costs are associated with the deployment of renewable energy sources, heating, hydrogen technologies, and the electricity grid. Costs for fossil fuels and carbon capture and transport technologies are relatively low. In terms of capacities, 200~GW of offshore wind, 3930~GW of solar PV, 1910~GW of onshore wind, and 1650~GW of electrolysis are installed in this setup.
In both cases, with and without \carbon{} transport, total costs decrease as the sequestration potential increases. At high sequestration rates, fossil fuels such as gas and oil are kept in the system. This reduces the need for synthetic FT fuel, which requires significant renewable energy sources. Simultaneously, the system deploys more \carbon{} removal technologies, such as DAC and Bioenergy with carbon capture (included in "Carbon Capture Technologies"), to offset emissions from fossil fuels.

The cost reduction when going to high sequestration in a system with \carbon{} transport is about 13\%, which is slightly more than without a \carbon{} network (11\%). Across all sequestration levels, a system with \carbon{} transport is, on average, 1.6\% less expensive. The cost savings for a carbon transport system are lowest at 0.5\% (4 billion euros per year) for a sequestration of 200~Mt and highest at 3\% (21 billion euros per year) for a sequestration of 1000~Mt.


To further investigate the switch in technologies, we analyze the annual operation of the system for different sequestration potentials. Figures~\ref{fig:operation_area_carbon_co2network}, \ref{fig:operation_area_hydrogen_co2network} and \ref{fig:operation_area_co2_co2network} show the balances of captured carbon, hydrogen and atmospheric \carbon{} in the system with \carbon{} transport as a function of the sequestration potential respectively. The areas in the positive segment indicate gross production of the respective commodity, while the areas in the negative segment indicate gross consumption.
Note that technologies with a ``*`` are explicitly augmented technologies with integrated carbon capture.
%

Figure~\ref{fig:operation_area_carbon_co2network} confirms our previous results and shows that FT synthesis production decreases with sequestration availability. At the same time, integrated carbon capture from Gas Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants, Allam Cycle plants, Steam Methane Reforming (SMR) and DAC increases. Other technologies are constant across varying levels of sequestration due to different reasons: biomass is bound by its maximum available potential (as reported in~\cite{enspreso_database}); the industry processes with their associated emissions are set to fixed values; the methanol production is bound by a lower limit representing the demand from the shipping sector.

% TODO: kerosine emissions from fossil based kerosine are not taken into account by the system.
Figure~\ref{fig:operation_area_hydrogen_co2network} shows that hydrogen production decreases by about 50\% when going from 200~Mt/a sequestration to 1000~Mt/a. In the last segment, hydrogen production from SMR starts to replace hydrogen production from electrolysis. Correspondingly, hydrogen demand for FT synthetic fuel production disappears, leaving only hydrogen demand for the shipping, industry and transport sector. Finally, Figure~\ref{fig:operation_area_co2_co2network} shows that the balance of the atmospheric \carbon{}. Note that the absolute value in the atmospheric \carbon{} hardly changes with the sequestration potential. This is because the switch from FT to fossil fuels is mirrored by a switch from using captured \carbon{} from biomass and DAC for FT synthesis to sequestering it underground. The net increase in DAC is solely due to an increase in unabated emissions from gas boilers.


We can conclude that in combination with a \carbon{} transport network, high rates of sequestration reduce the feasibility of CCU and hydrogen infrastructure and increases the feasibility of CCS, namely DAC and CC at point sources.

To answer the question of how carbon capture technologies at point sources change with the sequestration potential, we analyze the shift to carbon capture integration for all relevant technologies.
Figure~\ref{fig:captureshare_line} shows the share of a given technology that is equipped with integrated carbon capture, i.e., carbon capture at point source, for both with and without \carbon{} transport network.
With \carbon{} transport, all technologies except for SMR and Gas CHP are nearly fully equipped with CC across all sequestration potentials. As a result of sequestration, the share of SMR with carbon capture rises from 50\% to 100\%, and that of CHP from 0\% to 26\%. The technologies behave differently without carbon transport: besides the fact that capturing at point source is less attractive overall, their carbon capture shares rise more slowly as sequestration increases. The carbon capture share for process emissions even decreases. This is primarily due to the fact that as sequestration increases, the system relies more heavily on DAC and SMR with CC that can be flexibly placed near the sequestration sites.


Building on the analysis of optimal operation for varying sequestration potentials, we explore the spatial distribution of carbon capture and transport technologies for the most "optimistic" case of 1000~Mt/a sequestration potential and a carbon transport network.

Figure~\ref{fig:operation_map_noco2network_1000} shows a map of the total production and consumption of captured carbon in the system. The left side shows the combined carbon supply from carbon capture facilities and the carbon network flow. The right side illustrates regional carbon usage, again, together with the flow. Large capacity DACs and SMRs are placed close to shore with carbon capture in order to maximize efficiency. Significant facilities for DAC are built in the British Isles where carbon dioxide is used for methanol synthesis and also sequestration. Here substantial onshore wind farms generate a total annual production of approximately 400 TWh per year, of which 13\% is utilized by local DAC facilities. Other notable DAC installations are located on the Atlantic coast of Portugal, Spain, Ireland, and Denmark. Large facilities of SMR with CC are found in Portugal, South England and Greece. All these locations are in close proximity to sequestration sites, as indicated in Figure~\ref{fig:sequestration_map}. Note that the installation of SMR facilities close to the shore has the additional benefit of enabling easy transportation of hydrogen to ports for the shipping sector.


Looking at the transport of \carbon{} across the system, we observe that the carbon network primarily transports captured carbon from process and biomass emissions from the inland to sequestration areas. Note that optimization installs a number of separate carbon transport networks instead of building one large connected grid. Therefore, a large network cluster transports carbon from Central Europe to the North Sea. In contrast, three smaller clusters in the south of Europe transport carbon to the Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea.

As shown on the right, methanol production using captured carbon is primarily located in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and South Spain.

Finally, the deployment of carbon capture technologies in a system with high sequestration rates contrasts with the deployment of CCU facilities in a system with low carbon sequestration. On the one hand, with high sequestration, carbon capture management in the system is mainly driven by the location of the sequestration sites, leading to a spatially centralized deployment of carbon capture technologies. On the other hand, with low sequestration rates the use of CCU in a system is distributed more evenly across the system.


\section{Limitations}
\label{sec:limitations}

Despite the detailed model representation, there are some limitations to the validity of the results. The model itself is based on a linearized optimization with perfect foresight for the entire modeling year. In reality, long-term energy demand and renewable supply can only be roughly estimated, while short-term predictions still entail some uncertainty. The model's perfect foresight may lead to non-reproducible behavior, such as precisely aligning energy storage with future energy shortages at a specific point in time.

The technology costs used in the model rely on cost projections that incorporate reductions based on learning rates. These learning rates are derived from historical data, which may not necessarily be indicative of future trends. The model does not account for uncertainties arising from disruptive market behavior, such as the gas price peak that occurred in 2022.

% TODO: which fixed rate? you mean that all emissions are captured by exogenous assumption or that we assume 90% of carbon can be captured?
% Furthermore, the model assumes a fixed rate for industrial process emissions, which cannot be altered through investments. This simplification may not accurately represent real-world scenarios, where many industries are considering adopting low-carbon processes and technologies. The transport of fuel (FT, gas, oil) between the regions is not unlimited which may overestimate the flexibility provided by these commodities.

Lastly, the model's spatial and temporal resolution is insufficient to capture all relevant dynamics. Variations in renewable energy supply and energy demand below the applied time resolution, as well as more detailed interregional energy transport constraints, are currently not considered in the optimization. Transitioning to an hourly representation and a higher spatial resolution would increase the model's computational time and complexity, but would also enhance its robustness and validity.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this study, we investigated the impact of a \carbon{} transport system with different carbon sequestration potentials on the optimal configuration of technologies in a fully sector-coupled energy system in Europe, focusing on the deployment of carbon capture and Utilization (CCU) and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies. Our results indicate that increasing carbon sequestration potential leads to a decrease in total system costs, with a more pronounced cost reduction observed when a carbon transport network is present. Higher sequestration rates result in a shift from CCU and hydrogen infrastructure towards CCS and unabated fossil fuel usage compensated by carbon dioxide removal elsewhere in the system, particularly based on direct air and biomass carbon capture with sequestration.

Furthermore, we observed that with a \carbon{} transport network, the system tends to build out more carbon capture at point sources. With an increased sequestration potential, the share of technologies equipped with integrated carbon capture rises, particularly for Steam Methane Reforming (SMR) and Gas Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants. Independent of a setup with or without \carbon{} transport, the spatial distribution of carbon capture technologies becomes more centralized, with installations concentrated near sequestration sites.

Despite limitations of the study considering fixed model assumptions and cost uncertainties, our findings contribute valuable insights into the role of a carbon transport system and carbon sequestration potential in the transition towards a climate-neutral and net-negative energy system. As Europe strives to achieve its 2050 climate neutrality target, understanding the interplay between carbon sequestration, CCU, and CCS technologies will be crucial for the design of effective policies and strategies.
