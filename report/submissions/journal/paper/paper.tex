\begin{abstract}
    Hydrogen and carbon dioxide transportation are considered crucial in climate-neutral energy systems, with hydrogen transport enabling energy imports to high-demand areas and carbon transport aiding in emissions export from high-emission areas. Yet, possible synergies and competitions between the two systems are not fully understood. Our study employs optimization techniques to develop a cost-optimal European energy system, integrating production, transport and storage of both carbon dioxide and hydrogen, along with renewable energy sources. Results indicate that, in direct comparison, a hydrogen network is more cost-effective than a carbon network, facilitating low-cost hydrogen transport to Central Europe and local carbon capture and utilization. However, in a hybrid scenario, the carbon network effectively complements the hydrogen network, promoting carbon capture from biomass and reducing reliance on direct air capture. This research demonstrates the effectiveness of combining hydrogen and carbon transport networks with power grid expansion in achieving climate neutrality in Europe.

\section{Introduction}

The transition to a carbon-neutral European economy is a pressing challenge that demands coordinated action across various energy sectors. While management of both \COtwo{} and \Htwo{}, also refered to as carbon and hydrogen, is considered a critical component of this transition, a gap exists in understanding how new hydrogen infrastructure effectively interacts with carbon management technologies, including of carbon capture, transport, storage, utilization, and sequestration. Hydrogen offers an efficient way to transport and store energy over long distances and timeframes, and can be produced from electrolysis or steam methane reforming (SMR), for example. Carbon can be stored in geological formations to permanently extract it from the atmosphere, a process known as carbon sequestration (CS). Additionally, carbon can be combined with hydrogen to produce carbonaceous fuels as for example needed for aviation in form of synthetic kerosene from Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, for shipping in form of synthetic methanol and for industrial feedstocks through synthetic methane. From hereon, we jointly refer to the production of these carbonaceous fuels as Carbon Utilization (CU). Carbon can be effectively captured from industrial processes and the combustion of biomass, fossil fuels, or synthetic carbonaceous fuels through point-source carbon capture (CC) techniques, or harvested from the atmosphere using direct air capture (DAC). Both \COtwo{} and \Htwo{} networks are likely to play a crucial role in the cost-effective integration of these technologies to enable net-zero economies.

Recently, policymakers and industry in Europe have started developing hydrogen and carbon management strategies~\cite{GermanyDevelopingStrategy2023,CarbonManagementStrategie}, planning infrastructure components~\cite{CONetz}, and committing on the first carbon utilization projects~\cite{EFuelsPilotPlant2022,OrstedAssumesFull,GROUNDBREAKINGEFUELPRODUCTION,DLREfuelsDLR}. With the European Union's goal of achieving climate neutrality by 2050, a wide range of programs, funding models and initiatives have been established with dedicated instruments supporting both the ramp-up of the hydrogen and carbon economy~\cite{eu2023netzero,europeangreendeal,europeaninnovationfund}.
Collaborative industry initiatives like the European Hydrogen Backbone~\cite{gasforclimateEuropeanHydrogenBackbone2022} or the Hydrogen Infrastructure Map~\cite{H2InfrastructureMap} showcase the potential of hydrogen as a fuel and energy carrier. Some natural gas pipelines are already repurposed to transport hydrogen~\cite{RohrFreiFuer}. Business models from companies like Tree Energy Solutions~\cite{TESHydrogenLife2023}, Carbfix~\cite{WeTurnCO2}, and Equinor~\cite{adomaitisEquinorRWEBuild2023} advertise carbon management hubs that provide green hydrogen, methane, and synthetic fuels on the one hand and offer \COtwo{} offtake on the other hand. The Northern Lights project in Norway~\cite{NorthernLightsWhat} is planning with a transport and sequestration capacity of 1.5~Mt \COtwo{} per year to be operative in 2024, expanding to a targeted scale of 5~Mt per year of sequestration by 2030.
The market potential for carbon capture and sequestration in Europe is underscored by the Capture Map's estimated potential~\cite{ToolsGreenTransition} of 1.7 Gt carbon annually from point sources, accounting for about half of the continent's emissions, as well as estimated sequestration capacity potentials of up to 3~Gt/a~\cite{europeancommissionEuropeanCO2Storage}. However, it's important to note that carbon sequestration technology, unlike carbon capture, is not yet fully mature and its full potential and implications remain to be explored in depth.
To advance the carbon economy, the Clean Air Task Force emphasizes the importance of developing a carbon transport system in Europe alongside a hydrogen network~\cite{lockwoodEuropeanStrategyCarbon}. Carbon pipelines, considered a mature technology, have seen widespread installations in the United States and Canada, primarily for enhanced oil recovery~\cite{righettiSitingCarbonDioxide2017,friedmannNETZEROGEOSPHERICRETURN}.

However, up to this point, it remains unclear how the two transport systems of hydrogen and carbon may complement or replace each other. Both can bridge the misalignment of sources and sinks for carbon and hydrogen which may well be determined by exogenous factors. A hydrogen network can supply regions with geographically fixed hydrogen demand, such as for steelmaking, with hydrogen from regions with the best renewable resources as well as enable CU at the site of point-source CC. On the other hand, the carbon transport system allows for transporting captured carbon to regions with sequestration potentials or high-quality renewable resources, the latter enabling cost-effective CU.
In the literature, the two network approaches and underlying technologies have been discussed in a number of publications, all of which, however, dealt with the isolated effects~\cite{bakkenLinearModelsOptimization2008,morbeeOptimisedDeploymentEuropean2012,stewartFeasibilityEuropeanwideIntegrated2014,oeiModelingCarbonCapture2014,elahiMultiperiodLeastCost2014,burandtDecarbonizingChinaEnergy2019,middletonSimCCSOpensourceTool2020,bjerketvedtOptimalDesignCost2020,weiProposedGlobalLayout2021,damoreOptimalDesignEuropean2021,becattiniCarbonDioxideCapture2022,neumannBenefitsHydrogenNetwork2022}. Such techno-economic models, in contrast for example to Integrated Assessment Models, can account for the spatial distribution of carbon sources and sinks which are crucial to provide a holistic view of the energy system and its technological interactions. A remarkable example was developed by Neumann et al.~\cite{neumannBenefitsHydrogenNetwork2022}, which comprehensively demonstrates the interchangeability of hydrogen and electricity grid expansion in a climate-neutral European energy system at the expense of higher investments. The underlying, highly-resolved model encompasses most relevant sectors, however neglects the option to transport carbon across regions.
The publication by Morbee et al.~\cite{morbeeOptimisedDeploymentEuropean2012} optimizes the topology and capacity of a \COtwo{} network in Europe, but only considers the power sector without co-optimizing renewable deployment. This limited sectoral scope cannot capture important dynamics of carbon management, since it neglects the sectors that will need to handle most \COtwo{} in the future.
A comprehensive example is found in~\cite{becattiniCarbonDioxideCapture2022}, which presents a mixed-integer model to optimize the time-evolution of a \COtwo{} transport system in Switzerland, connecting to a remote sequestration site in Norway. However, this limited spatial scope fails to consider other sequestration sites and co-benefits from connecting the \COtwo{} network to neighboring countries.
Other high-resolution energy system models do not feature detailed CU technologies and \COtwo{} transport. Euro-Calliope, for example, does neither feature carbon nor hydrogen transport, and thus forces generic synthetic fuel production to rely on captive electrolysis and DAC in the same region~\cite{pickeringDiversityOptionsEliminate2022}.

To our knowledge, no study has yet considered the co-optimization and comprehensive assessment of both \COtwo{} and \Htwo{} networks in a fully sector-coupled energy system. However, we argue that such an assessment is strongly needed to identify realms of competition and synergy between hydrogen and carbon management technologies. In this paper, we present a detailed study of the European energy system for 2050, which includes high geographical resolution and a comprehensive representation of carbon management technologies. The study is conducted using the PyPSA-Eur energy system model which optimizes operation and investments in all relevant energy sectors. To investigate the competing transport dynamics between \COtwo{} and \Htwo{} networks, we contrast the following four models that have none of these networks, only one, or both combined:
%
\begin{itemize}
    \item[] \textit{Baseline:} Neither \COtwo{} nor \Htwo{} networks are constructed.
    \item[] \textit{\COgrid{}:} Only the \COtwo{} network is developed.
    \item[] \textit{\Hgrid{}:} Only the \Htwo{} network is developed.
    \item[] \textit{Hybrid:} Both \COtwo{} and \Htwo{} networks are developed.
\end{itemize}
%
In anticipation of the future \carbon{} emission targets, the models are subjected to the following two scenarios:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[] \textit{Net\=/Zero}: aligning with the EU's 2050 emission targets. Limiting carbon sequestration to 200~Mt/a. This scenario is also denoted as NZ.
    \item[] \textit{Net\=/Negative}: 10\% net-negative emissions relative to 1990 levels, equaling 460~Mt \COtwo{} annually. Limiting carbon sequestration to 660~Mt/a. Also denoted as NN.
\end{itemize}

We analyze how the deployment of carbon and hydrogen networks affects different decarbonization strategies in the models and scenarios and how investments in none or only one of the transport technologies lead to inefficient market layouts. We do this by first focusing on the net-zero scenario and a detailed description of the different technological and geographical impacts of the transportation systems. Subsequently our analysis demonstrates the extent to which different deployment strategies remain robust under a tightened emissions target in the Net-Negative scenario.



\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}


Focusing first on the Net-Zero scenario, we can highlight notable characteristics of the energy system buildouts shared by all models, as well as significant variations in system costs and technology deployment between the models (see Fig.~\ref{fig:cost_bar}).

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{comparison/default/figures/90_nodes/cost_bar.png}
    \caption[short]{Total annual system cost subdivided into groups of technologies for the different models of the European energy system with a net-zero emission target. While the \modBase{} has neither a \COtwo{} nor an \Htwo{} network, the \modHybrid{} is allowed to expand both. ``Gas Infrastructure'' combines gas facilities for power and heat production, ``\COtwo{} Infrastructure'' and ``\Htwo{} Infrastructure'' combine transport and storage for each carrier. ``Carbon Capture at Point Sources'' combines all technologies with integrated carbon capture, including the cost of the main facility (e.g., CHP unit) and the carbon capture application.}
    \label{fig:cost_bar}
\end{figure}

Total annual system costs in the \modBase{} are highest, totalling \label{}779~bn€. The models with additional transport options for carbon and hydrogen achieve a more efficient system allocation and lower total system costs, with \label{}3.1\% cost reduction (\label{}754~bn€) in the \modCO{}, and \label{}4.8\% (\label{}742~bn€) in the \modH{}, and \label{}5.2\% (\label{}738~bn€) in the the \modHybrid{}.

In all models, almost half of the system costs are spent on primary electricity production from wind and solar power, with around another \label{}10\% spent on hydro, nuclear and biomass. For the \baselinemodel, transmission system costs for electricity, gas, hydrogen and carbon are below \label{}4\% (\label{}25~bn€), with the electricity grid making up more of the system costs than the other three networks combined. This is not the case for the other models, where combined pipeline costs slightly surpass electricity transmission system costs (up to 20\% for the \hybridmodel). Capital expenditures on carbonaceous fuel production are around \label{}4\% (\label{}30~bn€) in each model, while electrolysis makes up around \label{}4.7\% (\label{}37~bn€). Heat pump installations account for around \label{}8\% of total system costs (64~bn€ in the \baselinemodel).

System cost differences between the models are driven by renewable energy resources (solar, wind, and bioenergy), the \COtwo{} and \Htwo{} networks, as well as carbon capture technologies (DAC and CC at point sources).
As we show below, these are due to substantial, albeit fundamentally different, gains in flexibility and a shift in carbon utilization and sequestration strategies by the \Htwo{} and \COtwo{} networks.

\subsection*{Transport systems unlock point\=/source carbon capture}

In comparison to the other three models, the \modBase{} reveals significant inefficiencies: On the one hand, regions with no access to sequestration sites (i.e., ``landlocked'' regions) underutilize CC potentials from process emissions, fossil gas and biomass. On the other hand, sequestration regions rely on costly DAC on-site. Furthermore, hydrogen and power prices show high regional differences, indicating system inefficiencies due to transport constraints caused by non\=/existent hydrogen or insufficient power transmission. Prices are significantly higher in Central Europe, a region with high population density and high concentration of energy-intensive industries.

By enabling the efficient transportation of carbon, hydrogen, or both, these models reduce the reliance on high-cost DAC, and source more carbon from low-cost point-source CC on biomass and gas in industrial applications (see Fig.~\ref{fig:balance_captured_carbon}). The \modH{} only captures \label{}193~Mt of \COtwo{} from DAC compared to \label{}392~Mt in the \modBase{}. Instead, the \modH{} captures more carbon from process emissions as well as gas and biomass for industry. The \modCO{} uses only \label{}154~Mt from DAC, and instead also captures more carbon than the \modH{} from gas for industry and biomass CHPs. And finally, the \modHybrid{} captures only \label{}112~Mt from DAC, but slightly more carbon from all other CC technologies.
Also, the transport of \carbon{} and \hydrogen{} reduce the reliance on methanation and therefore the overall demand for CC volumes in the model. Another knock-on effect of less reliance on DAC is its reduced endogenous demand for dedicated renewables as well as heat pumps and biomass CHPs to supply power and heat.


\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{comparison/default/figures/90_nodes/balance_bar_carbon.png}
    \caption{Balance of captured carbon for all models in the Net-Zero scenario. Positive values indicate carbon capture, negative values indicate carbon consumption. By integrating \Htwo{} and \COtwo{} networks, the predominant method for carbon removal shifts from Direct Air Capture (DAC) to a bioenergetic process that incorporates carbon capture. At the same time the reliance on methanation decreases.}
    \label{fig:balance_captured_carbon}
\end{figure}


The increase in captured carbon from point sources in the models with \carbon{} and/or \hydrogen{} transport is more related to an upgrading of existing industrial or power plant facilities to capture carbon rather than a shift in technologies. This is evident when analyzing the capture share of the different CC technologies (see Fig.~\ref{fig:captureshare_line}).


\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{comparison/default/figures/90_nodes/captureshare_line.png}
    \caption{Proportion of plants with integrated carbon capture for all models in the net zero scenario. The size of the dots corresponds to the average capacity factor of the respective technology. While peak load technologies such as gas-fired combined heat and power (CHP) plants, which are only in operation on a few days a year, are not expanded for carbon capture, baseload point sources such as biomass CHP and process emissions from industry are fully (partially) developed as soon as the transport of \COtwo{} (\Htwo{}) is permitted.}
    % A CO2 network unlock BECSS potentials, most biomass emissions are captured at point sources and transported to sequestration sites. cite~\cite{rosaAssessmentCarbonDioxide2021}
    \label{fig:captureshare_line}
\end{figure}%

In the \modBase{}, the capture share is highest for biogas-to-gas facilities, followed by process emissions, biomass for industry, biomass CHPs, gas for industry, SMR and gas CHPs. For models with additional transport systems, we observe a correlation between CC share and capacity factors of the underlying technologies: Process emissions as well as gas and biomass for industry have high capacity factors (above 80\%), and CC shares close to 100\%, the only exception being gas for industry in the \modH{}. Biomass CHPs have a capacity factor of around 50\%, and CC shares of 50\% in the \modH{} and 97\% in the \modCO{}. SMR and gas CHPs have capacity factors around 15\%, and CC shares at nearly 0\% for the \baselinemodel. The capacity factor and CC share of SMR increases to around 20\% and 50-65\%, respectively, in the other models. Gas CHPs serve as peak load electricity production technology, and with very few operating hours, thus the high investment costs into CC applications are not efficient. Similarly, SMR serves as ``peak-load'' hydrogen production technology in regions with poor renewable resources for electrolysis.


In summary, the implementation of \COtwo{} and \Htwo{} networks is instrumental in unlocking CC potentials and reducing system costs. However, despite the \modCO{} demonstrating higher amounts and shares of CC from point sources and therefore less DAC deployment, the \modH{} achieves even  lower total system costs (see Fig.~\ref{fig:cost_bar}).

% [potentially relevant text blobs from old 3.1]
% CU is preferably deployed in the regions where carbon, hydrogen as well as the inputs and by-product outputs (e.g., waste heat) of the synthesis processes have the lowest cost (or highest value).

% Now we turn to how carbon for CS is sourced by the different models. In the \modBase{}, because of the absence of a carbon network, all carbon that is sequestered (200 Mt, the same in each model) needs to be captured in the regions with access to an offshore CS site. The \modBase{} deploys all available low-cost point-source CC in these regions, and adds DAC in the sequestration locations with the lowest-cost electricity. In other words, the \modBase{} uses the atmosphere as a substitute carbon transport pathway, allowing \CO{} from inland point sources to escape into the atmosphere, and extracting it again from the atmosphere with DAC at the offshore locations.

% In the \modCO{}, the carbon network enables the system to capture carbon from low-cost point sources and transport it to the sequestration sites, trading off CC costs with transport costs.

% In summary, the \COtwo{} network enables the transport of carbon from the lowest-cost CC sources to CU and CS carbon sinks, reducing the need for high-cost DAC.
% The creation of an \Htwo{} network enables the cost-effective delivery of hydrogen from regions with a surplus of low-cost renewable energy to high-demand industrial centers with exogenous hydrogen demand and a surplus of low-cost CC potentials, reducing the need for DAC and for high-cost electrolysis at the industrial centers.
% This highlights how both the implementation of a \COtwo{} or an \Htwo{} network unlocks low-cost carbon capture potentials at geographically fixed point sources across the continent.


\subsection*{\Htwo{} network incentivizes distributed carbon utilization}\label{subsec:H2}

\begin{figure*}[ht!]

    }
    \label{fig:balance_map}
\end{figure*}

To find the reason for why the \Htwo{} network achieves lower system costs than the \COtwo{} network, it is crucial to understand the underlying mechanisms and geographical implications of the two transportation systems. Fig.~\ref{fig:balance_map} maps the average production, consumption and flow in the carbon (top row) and hydrogen (bottom row) sectors for the \modCO{} (left) and \modH{} (right). Each map displays circles indicating the production (top half-circle) and consumption (bottom half-circle) for each region, with lines and arrows representing the average import or export volumes and flow directions between regions. The color shading of each region corresponds to the average price of the carrier.

As we have also discussed above, the \modCO{} captures large amounts of carbon from bioenergy and industrial activities that were untapped in the \modBase{}. In particular, the carbon capture takes place in Central and Eastern Europe at relatively low cost, and almost none of the carbon is used locally (see Fig.~\ref{fig:balance_map}, top left). A large part of the captured carbon is transported from Western Europe to the Iberian Peninsula (70~Mt/h), the British Isles (66~Mt/h) and Denmark (25~Mt/h), where it is used along with low-cost electrolytic hydrogen to produce Fischer-Tropsch fuels and methanol. A second part of the captured carbon is transported to methanation plants in Italy and Greece (25~Mt/h), where the synthetic methane produced is fed into the well-developed gas grid, as Italy serves as a major gas import hub for Europe. Finally, a third part of captured carbon is transported directly to sites in the North Sea, Baltic Sea and Mediterranean Sea where it is sequestered. In absence of an \Htwo{} network, the system places most electrolysis in regions with the best renewable resources to supply local CU ($\sim$1100~GW$_\text{el}$), and smaller amounts of electrolyzers where hydrogen is needed for industrial processes across Central Europe ($\sim$75~GW$_\text{el}$). The model also emphasizes gas imports into Central Europe. Hydrogen prices vary strongly across the continent, with low price ``valleys'' in regions with good renewable resources such as the Iberian Peninsula or Denmark with around 60~€/MWh, and high price ``peaks'' in Central Europe with around 95~€/MWh (see bottom left).

To understand the dynamics of the \modCO{}, we observe that the system locates CU in the regions where it can minimize costs for its material inputs, carbon and hydrogen. As the \COtwo{} network largely smoothes out carbon prices across regions, CU is located in the hydrogen price valleys on the periphery of the continent. Similarly, the model locates CS in regions where it can minimize the costs of the carbon to be sequestered. Thus, CS is located in the carbon price valleys among the subset of regions with access to offshore sequestration sites. Due to the \COtwo{} network these low-price regions are not strongly pronounced, but still prevalent and impact CS locations. DAC is only used for CU and thus co-located in regions with a mix of low electricity costs (for running DAC) and low hydrogen costs.

The \Htwo{} network in the \modH{} on the other hand, transports low-cost hydrogen from regions with abundant renewable resources to regions with low-price carbon from abundant sources of fossil, biogenic and process emissions (see bottom right). The main transportation routes go from Spain (430~GW) and the United Kingdom (155~GW) to Central Europe to produce carbonaceous fuels with locally captured carbon from point sources. Also, the \Htwo{} network supplies exogenous \Htwo{} demand for industry in Central Europe (22~GW in total) at much lower costs than local electrolysis or SMR.

To explain the dynamics of the \modH{}, we observe that the model locates CU in the carbon price valleys across Western, Central and Eastern Europe (see top right), as the \Htwo{} network smoothes out hydrogen prices across the entire continent (see bottom right). CS is again located in the carbon price valleys among those regions with access to offshore sequestration sites. Due to the lack of a \COtwo{} network the full CC potentials from point sources are exhausted in all offshore sequestration regions, and the carbon is then sequestered. The additionally needed carbon to reach 200~Mt of CS is captured via DAC in the regions with access to offshore sequestration sites with the lowest costs for DAC, with the largest share deployed in Portugal (see top right). DAC is also used for CU in this model, and for both purposes DAC is located in the regions with the lowest costs for electricity.

In summary, both network models prefer CC from point sources distributed across the continent as well as electrolysis concentrated in regions with abundant renewable resources. The two network approaches reveal fundamentally different strategies to integrate these low-cost resources into the system: The \carbonmodel{} transports and sequesters low-cost carbon from distributed point sources and co-locates CU with low-cost electrolysis and DAC. The \hydrogenmodel{} distributes CU alongside with carbon point sources to which low-cost hydrogen from regions with abundant renewable resources is transported.
%
% However, differences between the two models are notable for the placement of CU, CS and DAC due to their distinct \COtwo{} and \Htwo{} price patterns. CU locations are more distributed in the \modH{}, while they cluster in a few valleys of low-cost \Htwo{} in the \modCO{}. CS co-locates in the regions with the lowest \COtwo{} costs (among those with offshore sequestration potential), but these regions are very different between the models. DAC is placed in regions with the best renewable resources in both models, but it is used for only CU in the \modCO{} and for both CU and CS in the \modH{}.
Finally, the system cost advantage of the \modH{} stems from being able to supply the exogenous hydrogen demands in Central Europe with low-cost hydrogen imports, while the \modCO{} is forced to deploy electrolysis in regions with poor renewables resources as well as additional gas infrastructure in Central Europe.

% TODO: smoother transition, incl. end of 3.2
% TODO: add network investment costs plot to Appendix. Mention investment H2 > CO2. (The investment in the hydrogen network is four times the investment in the carbon network.)
The \modHybrid{} combines the advantages of hydrogen and carbon networks, resulting in a cost reduction of \label{}5.2\% (\label{}41 billion euros) compared to the \modBase{}, which is lower than the cost reductions of the \COgrid{} and \modH{} (see Fig.~\ref{fig:cost_bar}). In particular, production, consumption and transport in the carbon and hydrogen sectors in the \modHybrid{} combine elements of the \carbonmodel{} and \hydrogenmodel{} (see Fig.~\ref{fig:capacity_maps}). While the topology of the \Htwo{} network roughly corresponds to that of the \modH{}, the \COtwo{} network plays more of a complementary role. In this section, we explore the advantages and disadvantages compared to the other models.

Similar to the \modH{}, the \modHybrid{} transports hydrogen from concentrated electrolysis sites in Western regions (Iberian Peninsula and British Isles) to distributed CU production sites across the continent. For the \COtwo{} network, this model employs short and direct pipeline routes, typically spanning one or two segments, to transport carbon from inland CC point sources to perform CS at nearby sequestration sites (e.g., Northern Germany, Italy and Greece). Additionally, the \COtwo{} network utilizes single-segment network sections to equalize local variations in carbon demand and supply to produce CU, thereby also further converging carbon prices. The model locates CU everywhere, except for a few coastal regions that perform CS, or that supply their locally captured carbon to a neigbouring sequestration region. DAC is deployed to supply carbon for the remaining CU needed by the model (mostly in Southern Spain).

Despite only a further reduction of \label{}0.4 percentage points (\label{}3~bn€) in total system costs compared to the \modH{}, the \modHybrid{} brings several advantages: (1) The \modHybrid{} relies even less on DAC than the other models, which as a technology may be costlier than anticipated in the cost projections, by making use of carbon point sources; (2) it requires a smaller land use footprint for wind and solar power due to lower DAC deployment. On the other hand, the \modHybrid{} needs slightly more biomass, equipped with carbon capture, to achieve its cost advantage in comparison to the \modH{}; (3) it uses both \COtwo{} and \Htwo{} networks to flatten price distribution across the continent and to build a more robust energy system.

\end{figure}


In the following, we analyze how investment trends and network strategies alter when transitioning from a net zero to a net emissions reduction target. Therefore, we subject the models to the Net-Negative scenario with a net carbon removal of 460~Mt/a and an increased total sequestration limit of 660~Mt/a. In comparison to the Net-Zero scenario, all models with transport options incur a roughly similar net annual cost increase - 77~bn€ for the \modCO{}, 81~bn€ for the \modH{}, and 78~bn€ for the \modHybrid{} (see Fig.~\ref{fig:net-negative_cost_bar}), resulting in a higher cost-benefit of 6~bn€ for the \hybridmodel{} in comparison to the \hydrogenmodel{}.

The models equally invest in the expansion of sequestration capacities up to the global limit (5~bn€). The investments in additional DAC (36-41~bn€), wind (6-7~bn€) and heat pumps (6-7~bn€) are relatively evenly for all models, with DAC accounting for roughly half of the additional system costs.
Fundamental differences in investment strategies occur in the deployment of solar, carbon capture and bio-energy technologies: While the \carbonmodel{} expands CC at point sources the most, the \hydrogenmodel{} and the \hybridmodel{} invest relatively more in new solar plants. The \carbonmodel{} invests three time more in new bio-energy sources (6~bn€) than the other models.
All models only reveal small net downscaling of technologies. However, as we discuss below, the geographic impact can vary depending on the model, sometimes leading to disruptive changes in optimal network strategies and stranded assets.


In contrast to its layout in the Net-Zero scenario, the \carbonmodel{} fundamentally reorganizes the carbon transport pathways (see Fig.~\ref{fig:balance_maps_co2_nn}).
In Spain, carbon utilization (CU) is now predominantly supplied by carbon extracted from DAC. Central Europe sees a major transformation, with carbon mainly being transported to sequestration sites in the north and south-east. This reorganization leads to stranded investment in the carbon network infrastructure, amounting to approximately 3~bn€.
%
The \modH{} on the other hand, primarily leaves the network topology unchanged and only expands DAC facilities at regions with access to sequestration sites as well as additional solar, wind and heat pumps in the vicinity to supply power and heat (see Fig.~\ref{fig:balance_maps_h2_nn}).
%
Finally, the \modHybrid{} expands the sequestration with carbon captured from bio-energetic inputs and transported from Central and Eastern Europe to the near shores (see Fig.~\ref{fig:balance_maps_full_nn}), leading to an additional investment in the \carbongrid{} (1.2~bn€, see Fig.~\ref{fig:cost_bar_transmission_nn}). At the same time, carbonaceous fuel production in Central Europe partially moves to Spain, where it uses carbon from new DAC facilities without the installation of a \COtwo{} network. As a trade-off, the model transports less hydrogen from the Iberian Peninsula to Central Europe, resulting in a dismantling of 2~bn€ in hydrogen network costs compared to the Net-Zero scenario.

These findings highlight the continued trends of the two systemic approaches which are combined in the \hybridmodel. With an increased demand for sequestration, the \carbongrid{} relatively gains more importance, leading to higher cost-benefits by enabling to combine increased need DAC with a more dominant collection and transportation scheme of carbon from distributed point sources.



\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}


Our study presents a comprehensive assessment of the roles of hydrogen (\Htwo{}) and carbon dioxide (\COtwo{}) networks in the future European energy system. By comparing models with and without these networks under net-zero and net-negative scenarios, we have elucidated the benefits and trade-offs associated with each approach. The Baseline model, lacking both \Htwo{} and \COtwo{} networks, shows significant inefficiencies and higher system costs. The \COgrid{} model, with its \COtwo{} network, effectively integrates low-cost carbon from distributed point sources, primarily for carbon utilization and sequestration. Conversely, the \Hgrid{} model, with its \Htwo{} network, facilitates low-cost hydrogen delivery to high-demand areas, thus enabling efficient carbon utilization alongside point-source carbon capture.
The Hybrid model, combining both \COtwo{} and \Htwo{} networks, leverages the strengths of each, resulting in the lowest system costs and a robust energy system. This model effectively utilizes \COtwo{} network for short-range carbon transport for sequestration and complements this with the \Htwo{} network for long-range hydrogen transport to support distributed carbon utilization. Under the net-negative scenario, the importance of Direct Air Capture (DAC) increases across all models, highlighting the growing significance of DAC in achieving deeper decarbonization goals.

Despite the comprehensive nature of the model, there are some limitations that affect the validity of the results, as well as important discussion points that need to be put into context.
In reality, energy demand and renewable supply can only be estimated for the next few hours/days. The model's perfect foresight may lead to non-reproducible technology dispatch which neglects uncertainties from long-term predictions and necessary reserve margins.
The modelling results are heavily driven by the demand and emissions from industrial clusters. Allowing the model to relocate these, incorporate flexibility measures or alter underlying processes, may lead to less dependency on both \COtwo{} and \Htwo{} networks.
The transport of fuel (FT, gas, oil) between the regions is not limited which may overestimate the flexibility provided by these commodities. However, the distributed CU systems in the \hydrogenmodel{} and \hybridmodel{} align well with today's distributed locations for oil-refineries, providing kerosene for aviation and naphtha for industry. The assumption to run Fischer-Tropsch facilities on baseload with at least 90\% of their nominal capacity, is likely shaping the deployment of CU, underestimating potential important flexibilities.
The assumed cost projections on technologies are subject to uncertainties. As shown in \ref{sec:subsidy}, the effect on a 50\% cost reduction on \carbon{} pipelines alter total system costs to small extent (below 1\%). However, a different set of cost on DAC and electrolysis may-well impact in the model results.
In combination with a net-zero or net-negative emission target, a relaxation of the global sequestration limit drives system costs down by introducing fossil fuels, as shown in~\cite{hofmannDesigningCO2Network2023}. Allowing the model to sequester onshore, would likely reduce the dominant co-location of CU with the point sources due to easier access to sequestration sites.
Finally, the large deployment of DAC is subject to conservative biomass potentials, as shown in~\cite{lauerCrucialRoleBioenergy2023}.

In summary, our study underscores the need for strategic planning and integration of both \COtwo{} and \Htwo{} networks in the European energy landscape. The flexibility and cost-effectiveness provided by these networks are pivotal for realizing the EU's climate neutrality ambitions. By harnessing the synergies between \Htwo{} and \COtwo{} transportation and management, Europe can effectively navigate the complexities of a transition to a sustainable, low-carbon energy future.


\section*{Methods}
\label{sec:methodology}

The study is conducted on the basis of the open-source, capacity expansion model PyPSA-Eur~\cite{horschPyPSAEurOpenOptimisation2018,brownSynergiesSectorCoupling2018,PyPSAEurSecSectorCoupledOpen2023}.
The model optimizes the design and operation of the European energy system, encompassing the power, heat, industry, agriculture, and transport sectors, including international aviation and shipping.
All technology cost assumptions are taken for the year 2040 and sourced from an open-source database~\cite{lisazeyenPyPSATechnologydataTechnology2023}.
Many of the assumptions contained therein are based on the technology catalogues published by the Danish Energy Agency~\cite{danishenergyagencyTechnologyDataGeneration2019,thedanishenergyagencyTechnologyDataCarbon2023}.
Endogenous model results include the expansion of renewable energy sources, storage technologies, power-to-X conversion and transmission capacities, heating technologies, peaking power plants, and the deployment of gray, blue or green hydrogen, among others.
The model considers various energy carriers like electricity, heat, hydrogen, methane, methanol, liquid hydrocarbons and biomass, together with the corresponding conversions technologies.

The figure shows the total annual energy demand for each energy source which determine the model's endogenous investments and operation. Endogenous processes can lead to higher total production volumes of some energy carriers, e.g., the demand for methanol requires more hydrogen and carbon as secondary (energy) inputs, which are not considered here.

In our configuration, the model's time horizon spans one year with a 3-hourly temporal resolution and a spatial resolution of 90 regions. Each of the regions consists of a complex subsystem with technologies for supplying, converting, storing and transporting energy. Exogenous assumptions on energy demand and non-abatable emissions are taken from various sources~\cite{piamanzGeoreferencedIndustrialSites2018,muehlenpfordtTimeSeries2019,mantzosJRCIDEES20152018,NationalEmissionsReported2023,EurostatCompleteEnergyBalance,uwekrienDemandlib2023}. The energy demand for electricity, transport, biomass, heat and gas are defined per region and time-step.
Land transport demand is exogenously assumed to be fully electrified, including heavy-duty vehicles.
Demands for kerosene for aviation, methanol for shipping, and naphtha for industry are not spatially resolved and assumed to be constant throughout all time-steps.
Heat demand is regionally subdivided into shares of urban, rural and industrial sites.
We show the sum of all energy demands in Fig.~\ref{fig:total-demand-bar}.
The system exogenously produces 633~Mt \COtwo{} per year from industry, aviation, shipping and agriculture, 153~Mt of which are fossil-based process emissions.
Location for industrial clusters are taken from~\cite{hotmaps_industrial_db}. Energy demand for industries are calculated from~\cite{mantzosJRCIDEES20152018}.

% Low-carbon electricity potentials

Low-carbon electricity is provided by wind, solar, biomass, hydro-electricity and nuclear power plants. Hydro-electric and nuclear plants cannot be extended beyond currently installed capacities. Weather-dependent power potentials for solar, wind and hydro-electricity are calculated from the reanalysis and satellite data sets, ERA5 and SARAH-2,~\cite{hersbachERA5GlobalReanalysis2020,pfeifrothSurfaceRadiationData2017} per region and time-stamp, using the open-source tool Atlite~\cite{hofmannAtliteLightweightPython2021}.
Solar and wind power can be expanded in alignment with land-use restrictions calculated, taking into account land usage classes and natural protection areas~\cite{eeaCorineLandCover2012,eeaNatura2000Data2016}. We restrict the total volume of power transmission expansion to 20\% of its current capacity, acknowledging the challenges in inaugurating new transmission projects.
For the use of biomass we consider only residual biomass products and no energy crops. We limit regional biomass use to the medium-level potentials from the JRC-ENSPRESO database~\cite{enspreso_database,instituteforenergyandtransportjointresearchcentreJRCEUTIMESModelBioenergy2015}. Inter-regional biomass transport is permitted with transport costs of $\sim$0.1~€/MWh/km considered.

% energy transport

The topology and capacities of the electricity transmission system are taken from the ENTSO-E transparency map~\cite{wiegmansGridkitExtractEntsoE2016} and selected Ten Year Development Plan (TYNDP) projects. The power flow is based on the lossless linearized power flow approximation~.
The topology of the \COtwo{}, \Htwo{} and gas network is identical to the topology of the electricity network, connecting all neighboring regions. Liquid fuels like oil, methanol and Fischer-Tropsch (FT) fuels are not spatially resolved, since transport costs per unit of energy are negligible due to their high energy density. Throughout this study, we focus on \COtwo{} and \Htwo{} networks because of their high relevance for infrastructure investments and thus public policy decisions. The electricity network and gas network are both included in the model with full geographical detail, but not further analyzed. Electricity networks are already in place, and we restrict further extension due to concerns of public acceptance. Gas networks also already exist, and will most likely experience decreased use in the future, removing any bottlenecks or constraints on the optimal system buildout or operation.
If enabled, hydrogen can be transported via pipelines between regions which can be expanded without limit, considering costs for pipeline segments and compressors. Pipeline flows are modelled using net transfer capacities and without flow dynamics, pressure valves, or energy demand for compression. No retrofitting of gas pipelines is considered.
% gas network data from SciGrid gas

% modelling of hydrogen supply chain pathways

In our model, we consider green, blue and gray hydrogen from electrolysis and steam methane reforming (SMR), the latter of which may be equipped with CC technology. The geographical distribution of underground hydrogen storage potentials in salt caverns is derived from Caglayan et al.~\cite{caglayanTechnicalPotentialSalt2020}. Re-electrification of hydrogen is possible via fuel cells.

% carbon utilisation

We argue that it is crucial for a proper modelling to consider CC, CU and CS as separate technologies, rather than grouping them under the often-used but misleading umbrella term ``carbon capture, utilization and storage'' (CCUS), to allow for independent optimization and adequate representation of each function in the carbon management system.
Our model features three drop-in fuel production technologies for CU: methanation, methanolization, and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis.
The processed fuels are not limited in their total quantity of use or production.
Methane is transported through the gas network, while methanol and FT fuel can be transported between regions without additional costs or capacity constraints.
Synthetic methane substitutes natural gas or upgraded biogas, serving combined heat and power plants, residential heating gas boilers, or industrial process heat.
Synthetic methanol decarbonizes marine industry fuel demands, and FT fuels replace fossil oil for naphtha production for high-value chemicals, aviation kerosene, or agricultural machinery oil.

% carbon supply
To supply carbon needed for CS and CU, the system can choose to deploy carbon capture (CC) technologies at various point sources of fossil or biogenic origin (see below), or through DAC facilities.
The concept of a merit order for captured carbon plays a pivotal role in optimizing the deployment of carbon capture technologies based on their economic feasibility.
This merit order ranks all CC technologies according to their relative costs to capture an additional marginal ton. The cost value for a technology depends on the exact system configuration and may vary by scenario and even by region, since many technologies produce other (primary) outputs such as electricity and heat. The costs to capture an additional marginal ton of carbon may also be different from the average cost of capture.
At the lower end of the cost spectrum, CC technologies applied to process emissions, such as those from cement, offer a cost-effective starting point.
Following this, biomass combined heat and power (CHP) systems provide a dual benefit of energy production and carbon capture.
Moving up the scale, gas used in industrial applications and biomass employed for industrial processes represent more costly yet viable options to capture carbon.
DAC, an emerging technology capable of extracting \COtwo{} directly from the atmosphere, stands at a higher cost level due to its current high capital costs and energy demand.
Finally, based on our model results, biogas upgrading, a process that refines biogas to natural gas quality, incurs the highest costs in the merit order per marginal ton of captured \COtwo{}.
Biogas input is a high-cost fuel which based on the endogenous modeling decisions is not used in large quantities.
To the extent that biogas-to-gas facilities are used by the model to supply additional (carbon-neutral) gas as fuel, adding CC infrastructure incurs low costs (and thus ranges on the left-hand side of the merit order curve).
However, the price of capturing additional \COtwo{} from biogas-to-gas upgrading is high because a substantial amount of the biogas fuel costs factors into the marginal cost of captured \COtwo{}.
This merit order framework is crucial for strategically deploying necessary carbon capture solutions while balancing economic considerations.
If we consider the spatial aspect of distributed carbon capture potentials, the \COtwo{} network can exploit comparative cost advantages between CO2 bidding zones to utilize the lowest-cost CC facilities across the continent.
We assume a capture rate of 90\% for CC on process emissions, SMR, biogas-to-gas, as well as gas and biomass used in industry, and 95\% for CC on biomass and gas CHPs.

% carbon storage and sequestration

To store carbon, we differentiate between short-term storage in steel tanks without permanent containment and long-term, irreversible sequestration in underground sequestration sites such as porous rock formations or depleted gas reservoirs.
Costs for both options are included in the model.
For carbon sequestration, we only consider offshore sites as potential sinks.
We make this choice because offshore sequestration sites typically have larger capacity compared to onshore sequestration sites in saline aquifers and due to concerns over public safety for infrastructure near populated areas.
Our estimates for carbon sequestration potentials are restrictive, limiting the annual sequestration potential to 25~Mt per region and constraining it further such that this amount could be  25 years.
Furthermore, we decide to limit the total amount of sequestered \COtwo{} to 200~Mt per year for our Net-Zero scenario and XXX~Mt per year for our Net-Negative scenario.
This is enough to offset hard-to-abate fossil process emissions (e.g., calcination of limestone in cement manufacturing) and some limited slack of fossil fuels to be used where they can be most valuable.
This is in order to avoid offsetting fossil emissions with carbon removal if they can technologically be avoided in the first place.

% [Dynamics \modCO{} vs \modH{} (old text blocks)]
% There are four notable dynamics or differences between the two network strategies:
% First, the production of FT fuels always moves to where low-cost carbon and low-cost hydrogen can be brought together. In the \modCO{ }, carbon is moved from Western Europe to the Iberian Peninsula, the British Isles and to Denmark to produce FT fuels centrally in few regions. In the \modH{}, hydrogen is transported in the opposite direction to produce FT fuels decentrally across all regions in Central Europe with locally captured \COtwo{} from point sources.
% Second, the \modCO{ } captures more low-cost carbon from biomass, especially in Central and Eastern Europe, and less high-cost carbon from DAC in Greece and Southern Italy. Instead, the \COtwo{} network transports carbon from Central and Eastern Europe to Greece and Italy, where it is sequestered, or feeds into CU together with locally produced, low-cost electrolytic hydrogen. The \modH{} directly operates electrolyzers and DAC in Greece and Southern Italy, with electricity from low-cost renewables, and thus avoids significant network buildouts in this region.
% Third, sequestration in the \modH{} occurs more decentralized, spread out across several regions with access to offshore sequestration sites, making use of point-source CC potentials in each of these regions. In the \modCO{ }, sequestration is clustered at fewer sequestration sinks, each collecting low-cost \COtwo{} from neighboring regions. However, there is no centralization at only one or two sites, since all the sequestration sites offer the same costs and the system minimizes system-wide carbon transport distances to about eight to ten sequestration sites.
% And fourth, how the three types of CU are spread across the continent is driven by the costs of carbon and hydrogen (the latter mostly driven by the costs of renewable electricity) as well as by renewables capacity factors: Clearly, all carbonaceous fuel production requires sites where both carbon and hydrogen are available, and they moreover prefer sites with low carbon and hydrogen prices. Based on our model assumptions, FT fuel synthesis has very limited flexibility and needs to be run alost at baseload (ramp-down only possible to 90\% of maximum load). Thus, for FT fuel synthesis sites in Northern Europe with more electricity from wind power are preferred to sites in Southern Europe, powered mostly by solar. Methanathion and Methanolisation both have higher flexibility, being able to ramp down to 50\% load during the night, for example. Thus, these fuel production sites prefer the best renewable resource sites in Southern Europe. And finally, as methanation produces synthetic methane that needs to be fed into the gas grid, methanation prefers those sites with good interconnection to the existing gas network. Since Italy possesses a large gas network with easy interconnection to Central Europe, methanation prefers sites in Southern Italy (and Greece, which would be connected to Southern Italy) over the Iberian Peninsula, where Methanolisation is more prevalent.

% In summary, the implementation of a \COtwo{} network allows for connecting regions with abundant, low-price carbon (from point sources) to regions that can sequester the carbon or that can produce low-cost hydrogen to make CU products (FT fuel, methanol, synthetic methane). DAC and electrolysis are deployed in the regions with the best renewable resources to meet carbonaceous fuel demands.
% In the absence of a \COtwo{} network and with an \Htwo{} network on the other hand, regions with access to offshore sequestration sites capture all carbon from low-cost point sources and then sequester it. The system deploys additional DAC facilities at the locations with sequestration access and low-cost renewables to capture the remaining necessary carbon for sequestration. Carbonaceous fuel demand is met at the locations which offer the best mix of low-cost carbon from point sources and low-cost hydrogen from renewables, with some additional electrolysis and DAC required to fully meet the demand.
% Sequestered carbon is nearly always transported before

% Therefore, one can conclude that a \COtwo{} network favors a decentralized CC and a CU centralized at regions with abundant renewable resources. An \Htwo{} network favors a centralized electrolysis system at regions with abundant renewable resources and a decentralized CU system.

% Together with understanding the dynamics described above, we can highlight three cost advantages of the \Htwo{} network in contrast to the \COtwo{} network: Capturing carbon at the lowest-cost regions reduces 4~bn€ in spending on DAC. However, the \modH{} produces electrolytic hydrogen in the lowest-cost regions and in total spends 7~bn€ less on renewable energy (14~bn€ less on solar, and 7~bn€ more on wind) as well as 1~bn€ less on SMR. Furthermore, without an \Htwo{} network, additional \Htwo{} storage is needed in Spain at a cost of 5~bn€ to store hydrogen produced during the summer for utilization in FT fuel production during the winter.
% And finally, the \modCO{ } spends 7~bn€ more on gas boilers, gas plants, gas infrastructure, and methanation.
% TODO: why??
% The costs of the respective networks, on the other hand, are almost equal: the \modCO{ } spends 8~bn€ on the \COtwo{} network, while the \modH{} even spends 10~bn€ on the \Htwo{} network. These factors add up to account for 14~bn€ of the difference of 20~bn€ in system costs between the two scenarios (785~bn€ for the \COgrid{} and 765~bn€ for the \modH{}, see Fig.~\ref{fig:objective_heatmap}).
