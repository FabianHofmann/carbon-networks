> The article presents an interesting analysis of the foreseen H2 and CO2 transport infrastructures.
> Literature is not accurate and there are many references cited without going in their details.
> The study lacks of realistic elements such as leakage issues, location of compression stations in relation with the capture location.


Thank you for your comments. We appreciate your feedback and will address your concerns in the revised manuscript.

We have expanded the literature review section to provide more context for the study. Since the study touches a wide range of topics in the political and technological landscape, we have tried to find a good balance between providing a comprehensive overview and keeping the text concise. (#TODO)

To simulate a more realistic transport system, the following assumptions have been integrated into the energy system model for transport efficiencies and compression requirements. For hydrogen pipelines an average loss of 1.2% per 1000 km, aligning with industry estimates that account for hydrogen's high permeability and small molecular size, which can lead to higher losses compared to other gases​. The compression energy required is assumed to be 1.8% of the transported energy, which is consistent with the significant energy demands for compressing hydrogen due to its low energy density​ [Environmental Defense Fund​](https://www.edf.org/sites/default/files/documents/Pipeline%20Methane%20Leaks%20Report.pdf). For natural gas pipelines, the model assumes a 1% loss rate per 1000 km, accounting for typical leakage and operational losses in well-maintained natural gas infrastructure​ as reported in [Global Energy Monitor](https://www.gem.wiki/Natural_gas_transmission_leakage_rates). The compression requirement is set at 1%, which falls within the common range for natural gas pipeline operations​ [Environmental Defense Fund​](https://www.edf.org/sites/default/files/documents/Pipeline%20Methane%20Leaks%20Report.pdf)​. For CO2 pipelines an average loss rate of 0.8% per 1000 km is reflecting a generally low leakage rate observed in supercritical or dense phase CO2 transport​ [SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-023-27289-3) [MDPI](https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/14/15/4601)​. The compression energy needed is set to 250 KWh per 1000km and tonne CO2 reflecting the energy required to compress and maintain CO2 in a supercritical state for efficient transport​.

> There are several graphs that make the reader confused rather than explain the amount of work done by the authors.

We have revised the figures to make them more accessible to the reader. However, we would appreciate it if you could provide more specific feedback on which figures you found confusing so that we can address these issues more effectively. Most of the figures are contain a lot of information which we find to be necessary to underline the argumentation. We have tried to make them as clear as possible.

## Reviewer #2 (Remarks to the Author):
@FabianHofmann

> Overall, a very impressive paper, with a very clear and concise structure, easy to follow with many interesting insights. The research gap and necessity of the paper clearly are demonstrated, the topic is higly relevant and the chosen methodology are well suited for the task.

> There are a couple of aspects I would like to understand better, i.e. aspects in which I think additional information would be beneficial.

> 1: CCS is a challenge for scenario analyses like yours, since it low cost makes it a backstop technology. The model will try to solve many things with CCS if one does not prevent somehow. Your approach is to limit CS. “This is in order to avoid offsetting fossil emissions with carbon removal if they can technologically be avoided in the first place.” I was wondering about this throughout the paper. So, first of all I could be helpful to point out the importance and weight of this setting early in the text. I think the implications of this should be discussed more, because I believe this to be crucial: At your point of operation, your model is able to provide and sequester CO2 for roughly160 €/t if I’m correct. That basically means that all mitigation measures costlier than that are only part of the solution because of the CS limit. It would be interesting to discuss the dual value/shadow price of tis cap, to understand how much economic pressure could be on relying more on CCS. The fossil lock-in your CS cap prevents could be an economically very attractive. So, if compensating fossil fuel usage is cheaper than the chosen path of FT and other PtX options, I think this would deserve a discussion in the paper. Especially because the compensation would not need to take place in Europe but could be done in regions with even lower DACS/BECCS costs.

> 2. The H2 provision in the Baseline case confuses me a bit, namely that it works surprisingly well. How is a constant supply possible in regions without geological storage potential? Does this mean that in hours of low/no RES power plants in the regions with storages produce electricity, which is then brought to H2 sinks and turned into H2 again? In our scenarios this led to much bigger costs and almost impossible necessities for electricity network expansions. Is this because your H2 demand is relatively low, and you transform it into other carriers? Or do you have some other form of storage option at the consumption sites. Overall, I would just like to understand better how you supply H2 steadily without a network.

@fneum
> 3: In the introduction: “It is assumed that Europe is self-sufficient in energy and does not import any fuels.” I would like to see the consequences of this setting discussed, especially regarding the large liquid quantities it entails. Just a suggestion, but a variation in which half of the quantities are imported discussed briefliy in the Annex would be very valuable. Much of the infrastructure you model and discuss discuss hinges on this, and importing a major share is clearly an realistic and attractive option in reality.

@chrstphtrs
> Your H2 prices seem comparatively low to similar exercises. What interest rate/ WACC did you use? I think that should always be made explicit, as it has huge a impact on many results.



---
@FabianHofmann
> Maybe this would be to much, but while seeing your H2 prices I was very interested in seeing your electricity prices. If a map/maps would be too much, maybe state the ranges somewhere for reference?

@chrstphtrs
> I think an overview table with differences of the scenario settings in the beginning would be helpful, and maybe with some key results in the end.

@FabianHofmann
> The colour coding in Figure 6 could be better, the greens are almost indistinguishable and too many similar browns.

@chrstphtrs
> In the end of section 2: “In the network layouts, the slight shift in CU deployment results in a partial dismantling of hydrogen pipelines, especially from the Iberian Peninsula to Central Europe (0.5 bn€/a).” Is “dismantling” really the right word here? The model simply does not build those pipelines in this scenario, and you cannot dismantle what you never built. Or maybe you can, and this is a tricky koan.

@chrstphtrs
> “High-cost Direct Air Capture”: I may be nitpicking, but I was wondering whether this expression is really fair in combination with the CS cap. I think you force the model to pursue many even more expensive option like FT, this is just the most expensive carbon option for sequestration. Again, really just a thought.
