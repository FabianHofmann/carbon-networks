  abstract = {This work presents a novel optimization framework for the optimal design of carbon capture, transport, and storage supply chains in terms of installation, sizing and operation of carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and transport technologies. The optimal design problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program that minimizes the total costs of the supply chains while complying with different emissions reduction pathways over a deployment time horizon of 25 years. All design decisions are time-dependent and are taken with a yearly resolution. Whereas the model is general, here its features are illustrated by designing optimal supply chains to decarbonize the Swiss waste-to-energy sector, for various emission reduction pathways, when up to two storage sites are considered, namely one in the North Sea assumed to be already available and a hypothetical one in Switzerland assumed to be possibly available in the future. Findings show that, unless a domestic storage site becomes available soon, the transport cost is the greatest contribution to the overall costs, followed by the capture cost, while the storage cost plays only a minor role. Pipelines are the most cost-effective mode of transport for large volumes of transported CO2, especially when considering multi-year time horizons for the planning of the supply chains. Ship and barge connections are competitive with pipeline connections, whereas rail and truck connections are cost-optimal only when considering shortsighted time horizons or small volumes of CO2 transported.},

  abstract = {There are two competing concepts for the integration of high shares of renewable energy: the coupling of electricity to other energy sectors, such as transport and heating, and the reinforcement of transmission networks. In this paper both sector coupling and continent-wide grid integration are considered in the model PyPSA-Eur-Sec-30, the first open, spatially-resolved, temporally-resolved and sector-coupled energy model of Europe. Using a simplified network with one node per country, the cost-optimal system is calculated for a 95\% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions compared to 1990, incorporating electricity, transport and heat demand. The demand-side management potential from battery electric vehicles (BEV), power-to-gas units (P2G) and long-term thermal energy storage (LTES) make a significant contribution to the smoothing of variability from wind and solar and to the reduction of total system costs. The cost-minimising integration of BEV pairs well with the daily variations of solar power, while P2G and LTES balance the synoptic and seasonal variations of demand and renewables. In all scenarios, an expansion of cross-border transmission reduces system costs, but the more tightly the energy sectors are coupled, the weaker the benefit of transmission becomes.},

This paper, therefore, describes three potential decarbonization pathways to analyze different effects for the electricity, transport, heating, and industrial sectors until 2050. Using an enhanced version of the multi-sectoral, open-source Global Energy System Model, enables us to assess the impact of different CO2 budgets on the upcoming energy system transformation. A detailed provincial resolution allows for the implementation of regional characteristics and disparities within China. Conclusively, we complement the model-based analysis with a quantitative assessment of current barriers for the needed transformation. Results indicate that overall energy system CO2 emissions and in particular coal usage have to be reduced drastically to meet (inter-) national climate targets. Specifically, coal consumption has to decrease by around 60\% in 2050 compared to 2015. The current Nationally Determined Contributions proposed by the Chinese government of peaking emissions in 2030 are, therefore, not sufficient to comply with a global CO2 budget in line with the Paris Agreement. Renewable energies, in particular photovoltaics and onshore wind, profit from decreasing costs and can provide a more sustainable and cheaper energy source. Furthermore, increased stakeholder interactions and incentives are needed to mitigate the resistance of local actors against a low-carbon transformation.},

Based on model results for numerous scenarios and sensitivity runs, we analyse key issues to explore feasibility, uncertainties, costs and priorities for climate-neutrality strategy. We suggest that a sustainable climate-neutral energy system in the EU is feasible using known technologies. We emphasise that the EU's climate and energy package for 2030 currently in legislation is not sufficient to ensure climate neutrality by 2050. We characterise as of ``no-regret'' options promoting energy efficiency, renewables and electrification where cost-effective. However, carbon neutrality also necessitates alternative options of ``disruptive'' nature. Technologies supporting the disruptive options are not yet mature in industry. High uncertainty surrounds their learning potential. Their deployment heavily depends on policies facilitating investment. The system analysis based on the model illustrates the importance of sectoral integration. We argue that hydrogen, and to a certain extent synthetic carbon-neutral hydrocarbons, are critical elements among the disruptive options.},

  abstract = {Import and export of fossil energy carriers are cornerstones of energy systems world-wide. If energy systems are to become climate neutral and sustainable, fossil carriers need to be substituted with carbon neutral alternatives or electrified if possible. We investigate synthetic chemical energy carriers, hydrogen, methane, methanol, ammonia and Fischer-Tropsch fuels, produced using electricity from renewable energy sourceses as fossil substitutes. Renewable energy sourceses potentials are obtained from GIS-analysis and hourly resolved time-series are derived using reanalysis weather data. We model the sourcing of feedstock chemicals, synthesis and transport along nine different energy supply chains to Germany. and compare import options for seven locations around the world against each other and with domestically sourced alternatives on the basis of their respective cost per unit of hydrogen and energy delivered. We find that for each type of chemical energy carrier an import option with lower costs compared to domestic production in Germany exists. The lowest cost import options for energy and hydrogen are by hydrogen pipeline from Denmark, Spain and Western Asia and North Africa at 40.6 to 46.8 EUR per MWh (LHV) (1.4 to 1.6 EUR per kg H2) in 2050 assuming 5\% p.a. capital cost. For complex energy carriers like methane, ammonia, methanol or Fischer-Tropsch fuel, imports from Argentina by ship to Germany are attractive even compared to closer European Union or Western Asia and North Africa exporters. For meeting hydrogen demand, direct hydrogen imports are more attractive than indirect routes using methane, methanol or ammoniaimports and subsequent decomposition to hydrogen because of high capital investment costs and energetic losses of the indirect routes. We make our model and data available under open licenses for adaptation and reuse.},

However, carbon emissions of CHP challenge the pollution and economic optimization of integrated energy system (IES). To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel model and optimal dispatch for CHP with power-to-gas (P2G) and carbon capture system (CCS), which solves the problems of the carbon source required for P2G and the CHP's carbon emissions by the optimal dispatch in IES. The model takes the CHP, P2G, and CCS as a whole system. The operation rule of the model is developed, and its coupling characteristics of electric power, heat power, gas power and carbon are analyzed. Correspondingly, the optimization strategy of IES considers the proposed model and carbon trading mechanism. The optimal dispatch model of IES is established and solved by YALMIP, and GUROBI. Our method is verified by simulation. Compared with other conventional models, the accommodation capacity of renewable energy with the proposed method is enhanced, and the carbon emissions and operating costs of IES are also reduced.},

This effort will require careful and comprehensive planning to ensure that capture locations, storage sites, and the dedicated CO2 distribution pipelines are selected in a robust and cost-effective manner. Introduced in 2009, SimCCS is an optimization model for integrated system design that enables researchers, stakeholders, and policy makers to design CCS infrastructure networks. SimCCS2.0 is a complete, ground-up redesign that is now a portable software package, useable and shareable by the CCS research, industrial, policy, and public communities. SimCCS2.0 integrates multiple new capabilities including a refined optimization model, novel candidate network generation techniques, and optional integration with high-performance computing platforms. Accessing user-provided CO2 source, sink, and transportation data, SimCCS2.0 creates candidate transportation routes and formalizes an optimization problem that determines the most cost-effective CCS system design. This optimization problem is then solved either through a high-performance computing interface, or through third-party software on a local desktop computing platform. Finally, SimCCS2.0 employs an open-access geographic information system framework to enable analysis and visualization capabilities. SimCCS2.0 is written in Java and is publicly available via GitHub to encourage collaboration, modification, and community development.},

  abstract = {Future 100\% renewable energy systems will have to integrate different sectors, including provision of power, heating, cooling and transport. Such energy systems will be needed to mitigate the negative impacts of economic development based on the use of fossil fuels, but will rely on variable renewable energy resources. As two-thirds of global greenhouse gas emissions can be attributed to fossil fuel combustion, decarbonization of energy systems is imperative for combating the climate change. Integrating future energy systems with CO2 capture and utilization technologies can contribute to deep decarbonization. As these technologies can be operated flexibly, they can be used to balance the grid to allow for high levels of variable renewable energy in the power mix. The captured CO2 can be either utilized as a feedstock for various value-added applications in the chemical industry and related sectors such as the food and beverage industries. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art literature on CO2 capture and utilization technologies, with an emphasis on their potential integration into a low-carbon, high-renewables penetration grid. The potential market size for CO2 as raw material is also elaborated and discussed. The review paper provides an insight to the development and the technological needs of different energy system sectors, as well the limitations, challenges and research gaps to the integration of the variable renewable energy sources and flexible carbon capture and utilization technologies.},

  abstract = {Electricity transmission expansion has suffered many delays in Europe in recent decades, despite its importance for integrating renewable electricity into the energy system. A hydrogen network which reuses the existing fossil gas network would not only help supply demand for low-emission fuels, but could also help to balance variations in wind and solar energy across the continent and thus avoid power grid expansion. We pursue this idea by varying the allowed expansion of electricity and hydrogen grids in net-zero CO\$\_2\$ scenarios for a sector-coupled European energy system with high shares of renewables and self-sufficient supply. We cover the electricity, buildings, transport, agriculture, and industry sectors across 181 regions and model every third hour of a year. With this high spatio-temporal resolution, we can capture bottlenecks in transmission and the variability of demand and renewable supply. Our results show a consistent benefit of a pan-continental hydrogen backbone that connects high-yield regions with demand centers, synthetic fuel production and geological storage sites. Developing a hydrogen network reduces system costs by up to 6\%, with highest benefits when electricity grid reinforcements cannot be realised. Between 58\% and 66\% of this backbone could be built from repurposed natural gas pipelines. However, we find that hydrogen networks can only partially substitute for power grid expansion, and that both can achieve strongest cost savings of 12\% together.},

  abstract = {Not only due to the energy crisis European policymakers are exploring options to substitute natural gas with renewable hydrogen. A condition for the application of hydrogen is a functioning logistic chain. However, researchers are still discussing the most efficient way to transport large hydrogen quantities. A promising option is to convert the existing natural gas infrastructure, but technical and economical evaluation and comparison of converted transportation networks are missing. This study presents a novel approach to develop hydrogen networks by applying the Steiner tree algorithm to derive candidates and evaluate their costs. This method uses the existing grid (brownfield) and is compared to a newly built grid (greenfield). The methodology is applied to the German gas grid and demand and supply scenarios covering the industry, heavy-duty transport, power, and heating sector, imports, and domestic production. Five brownfield candidates are compared to a greenfield candidate. The candidates differ by network length and pipeline diameters to consider the transported volume of hydrogen. The economic evaluation concludes that most brownfield candidates' cost is significantly lower than of the greenfield candidate. The candidates can serve as starting points for flow simulations and policymakers can estimate the cost based on the results.},

  abstract = {Europe's contribution to global warming will be determined by the cumulative emissions until climate neutrality is achieved. Here, we investigate alternative transition paths under different carbon budgets. We use PyPSA-Eur-Sec, an open model of the sector-coupled European energy system with high spatial and temporal resolution. All the paths entail similar technological transformations, but the timing of the scale-up of important technologies like electrolysis, carbon capture, and hydrogen network differs. Solar PV and onshore and offshore wind become the cornerstone of a net-zero energy system, enabling the decarbonization of other sectors via direct electrification (heat pumps and electric vehicles) or indirect electrification (using synthetic fuels). For a social cost of carbon (SCC) of 120V/tCO2, transition paths under 1.5 and 1.6 C budgets are, respectively, 8\% and 1\% more expensive than the 2 C budget because building assets earlier costs more. The 1.5 C budget is cost optimal if a SCC of at least 300V/tCO2 is considered.},

  abstract = {A straightforward global layout of carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) is imperative for limiting global warming well below 2\,\textdegree C. Here, we propose a cost-effective strategy for matching carbon sources and sinks on a global scale. Results show 3,093 carbon clusters and 432 sinks in 85 countries and regions are selected to achieve 92\,GtCO2 mitigation by CCUS, 64\% of which will be sequestered into sedimentary basins for aquifer storage and 36\% will be used for CO2-EOR (enhanced oil recovery). Of the identified source\textendash sink matching, 80\% are distributed within 300\,km and are mainly located in China, the United States, the European Union, Russia and India. The total cost is \textasciitilde 0.12\% of global cumulative gross domestic product. Of countries with CO2-EOR, 75\% will turn into profitable at the oil price over US\$100 per barrel. These findings indicate our proposed layout is economically feasible. However, its implementation requires global collaboration on financial and technological transfer.},

  abstract = {The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5\textdegree C points to the need for carbon neutrality by mid-century. Achieving this in the United States in only 30 years will be challenging, and practical pathways detailing the technologies, infrastructure, costs, and tradeoffs involved are needed. Modeling the entire U.S. energy and industrial system with new analysis tools that capture synergies not represented in sector-specific or integrated assessment models, we created multiple pathways to net zero and net negative CO2 emissions by 2050. They met all forecast U.S. energy needs at a net cost of 0.2\textendash 1.2\% of GDP in 2050, using only commercial or near-commercial technologies, and requiring no early retirement of existing infrastructure. Pathways with constraints on consumer behavior, land use, biomass use, and technology choices (e.g., no nuclear) met the target but at higher cost. All pathways employed four basic strategies: energy efficiency, decarbonized electricity, electrification, and carbon capture. Least-cost pathways were based on {$>$}80\% wind and solar electricity plus thermal generation for reliability. A 100\% renewable primary energy system was feasible but had higher cost and land use. We found multiple feasible options for supplying low-carbon fuels for non-electrifiable end uses in industry, freight, and aviation, which were not required in bulk until after 2035. In the next decade, the actions required in all pathways were similar: expand renewable capacity 3.5 fold, retire coal, maintain existing gas generating capacity, and increase electric vehicle and heat pump sales to {$>$}50\% of market share. This study provides a playbook for carbon neutrality policy with concrete near-term priorities.},
