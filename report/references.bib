  abstract = {The European Union has set ambitious CO2 reduction targets, stimulating renewable energy production and accelerating deployment of offshore wind energy in northern European waters, mainly the North Sea. With increasing size and clustering, offshore wind farms (OWFs) wake effects, which alter wind conditions and decrease the power generation efficiency of wind farms downwind become more important. We use a high-resolution regional climate model with implemented wind farm parameterizations to explore offshore wind energy production limits in the North Sea. We simulate near future wind farm scenarios considering existing and planned OWFs in the North Sea and assess power generation losses and wind variations due to wind farm wake. The annual mean wind speed deficit within a wind farm can reach 2\textendash 2.5 ms-1 depending on the wind farm geometry. The mean deficit, which decreases with distance, can extend 35\textendash 40 km downwind during prevailing southwesterly winds. Wind speed deficits are highest during spring (mainly March\textendash April) and lowest during November\textendash December. The large-size of wind farms and their proximity affect not only the performance of its downwind turbines but also that of neighboring downwind farms, reducing the capacity factor by 20\% or more, which increases energy production costs and economic losses. We conclude that wind energy can be a limited resource in the North Sea. The limits and potentials for optimization need to be considered in climate mitigation strategies and cross-national optimization of offshore energy production plans are inevitable.},

Although observations and numerical simulations have indicated an upper bound to the power density in the order of 1 W/m2, no theoretical foundation has yet been provided. Here, we study the role of atmospheric pressure gradients and the latitude-dependent Coriolis parameter in the power density of large-scale wind farms by means of both numerical atmospheric simulations and analytic expressions. We illustrate that energy transport to regional-scale wind farms is primarily governed by horizontal pressure gradients and their interaction with the Coriolis force and turbine-induced surface drag within the latitude-dependent Ekman layer. Higher pressure gradients and lower Coriolis parameters promote higher energy availability and, consequently, higher potential power density, suggesting that the power density of regional-scale wind farms is largely resource- and location-dependent.},

The optimal design problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program that minimizes the total costs of the supply chains while complying with different emissions reduction pathways over a deployment time horizon of 25 years. All design decisions are time-dependent and are taken with a yearly resolution. Whereas the model is general, here its features are illustrated by designing optimal supply chains to decarbonize the Swiss waste-to-energy sector, for various emission reduction pathways, when up to two storage sites are considered, namely one in the North Sea assumed to be already available and a hypothetical one in Switzerland assumed to be possibly available in the future. Findings show that, unless a domestic storage site becomes available soon, the transport cost is the greatest contribution to the overall costs, followed by the capture cost, while the storage cost plays only a minor role. Pipelines are the most cost-effective mode of transport for large volumes of transported CO2, especially when considering multi-year time horizons for the planning of the supply chains. Ship and barge connections are competitive with pipeline connections, whereas rail and truck connections are cost-optimal only when considering shortsighted time horizons or small volumes of CO2 transported.},

  abstract = {This study investigates the impact of operational fluctuations and uncertainties on the design and expected cost of ship-based CO2 transport. The model analysis is based on a two-stage stochastic investment model for a single-source single-sink CCS value chain with a ship-based transport system. The sailing time of the ship is uncertain due to changing weather conditions. The optimal investment decisions are driven by the expected cost of operating the value chain in the stochastic operational scenarios. This approach is demonstrated on a case study in which 0.4 MtCO2/y is transported over 715 km, from a cement plant located in Brevik to a harbor in Kollsnes in Norway. The results show that a transport rate of 99 \% of the available CO2 leads to the lowest average cost of transport at 33.8 \texteuro/ton. Once the delays caused by the weather are considered, the buffer storage capacity that is 18 \% above the ships transport capacity, seems to be the most efficient solution for recovering normal operation after weather delays. The expected transport cost increases with 1.9 \texteuro/ton (i.e. 5\%) when the uncertainty in weather conditions is neglected in the value chain design decisions. Furthermore, seasonal variations in emissions lead to the need of a larger ship rather than maintaining the same ship size and increasing the power when required. The seasonal storage of CO2 never appears to be a cost-efficient strategy, compared to increasing ship capacity. Finally, the risks of higher future fuel prices and ship breakdowns will cause the value of buffer storage capacity to increase, and thus resulting to select a buffer capacity up to 73 \% larger than the ship size.},

In this paper both cross-sector and cross-border integration are considered in the model PyPSA-Eur-Sec-30, the first open, spatially-resolved, temporally-resolved and sector-coupled energy model of Europe. Using a simplified network with one node per country, the cost-optimal system is calculated for a 95\% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions compared to 1990, incorporating electricity, transport and heat demand. Flexibility from battery electric vehicles (BEV), power-to-gas units (P2G) and long-term thermal energy storage (LTES) make a significant contribution to the smoothing of variability from wind and solar and to the reduction of total system costs. The cost-minimising integration of BEV pairs well with the daily variations of solar power, while P2G and LTES balance the synoptic and seasonal variations of demand and renewables. In all scenarios, an expansion of cross-border transmission reduces system costs, but the more tightly the energy sectors are coupled, the weaker the benefit of transmission reinforcement becomes.},

This paper, therefore, describes three potential decarbonization pathways to analyze different effects for the electricity, transport, heating, and industrial sectors until 2050. Using an enhanced version of the multi-sectoral, open-source Global Energy System Model, enables us to assess the impact of different CO2 budgets on the upcoming energy system transformation. A detailed provincial resolution allows for the implementation of regional characteristics and disparities within China. Conclusively, we complement the model-based analysis with a quantitative assessment of current barriers for the needed transformation. Results indicate that overall energy system CO2 emissions and in particular coal usage have to be reduced drastically to meet (inter-) national climate targets. Specifically, coal consumption has to decrease by around 60\% in 2050 compared to 2015. The current Nationally Determined Contributions proposed by the Chinese government of peaking emissions in 2030 are, therefore, not sufficient to comply with a global CO2 budget in line with the Paris Agreement. Renewable energies, in particular photovoltaics and onshore wind, profit from decreasing costs and can provide a more sustainable and cheaper energy source. Furthermore, increased stakeholder interactions and incentives are needed to mitigate the resistance of local actors against a low-carbon transformation.},

  abstract = {The role of hydrogen in a future energy system with a high share of variable renewable energy sources (VRES) is regarded as crucial in order to balance fluctuations in electricity generation. These fluctuations can be compensated for by flexibility measures such as the expansion of transmission, flexible generation, larger back-up capacity and storage. Salt cavern storage is the most promising technology due to its large storage capacity, followed by pumped hydro storage. For the underground storage of chemical energy carriers such as hydrogen, salt caverns offer the most promising option owing to their low investment cost, high sealing potential and low cushion gas requirement. This paper provides a suitability assessment of European subsurface salt structures in terms of size, land eligibility and storage capacity. Two distinct cavern volumes of 500,000~m3 and 750,000~m3 are considered, with preference being given for salt caverns over bedded salt deposits and salt domes. The storage capacities of individual caverns are estimated on the basis of thermodynamic considerations based on site-specific data. The results are analyzed using three different scenarios: onshore and offshore salt caverns, only onshore salt caverns and only onshore caverns within 50~km of the shore. The overall technical storage potential across Europe is estimated at 84.8 PWhH2, 27\% of which constitutes only onshore locations. Furthermore, this capacity decreases to 7.3 PWhH2 with a limitation of 50~km distance from shore. In all cases, Germany has the highest technical storage potential, with a value of 9.4 PWhH2, located onshore only in salt domes in the north of the country.

  abstract = {Future energy supply systems must become more flexible than they are today to accommodate the significant contributions expected from intermittent renewable power sources. Although numerous studies on planning flexibility options have emerged over the last few years, the uncertainties related to model-based studies have left the literature lacking a proper understanding of the investment strategy needed to ensure robust power grid expansion. To address this issue, we focus herein on two important aspects of these uncertainties: the first is the relevance of various social preferences for the use of certain technologies, and the second is how the available approaches affect the flexibility options for power transmission in energy system models. To address these uncertainties, we analyze a host of scenarios. We use an energy system optimization model to plan the transition of Europe's energy system. In addition to interacting with the heating and transport sectors, the model integrates power flows in three different ways: as a transport model, as a direct current power flow model, and as a linearized alternating current power flow model based on profiles of power transfer distribution factors. The results show that deploying transmission systems contribute significantly to system adequacy. If investments in new power transmission infrastructure are restricted\textemdash for example, because of social opposition\textemdash additional power generation and storage technologies are an alternative option to reach the necessary level of adequacy at 2\% greater system costs. The share of power transmission in total system costs remains widely stable around 1.5\%, even if cost assumptions or the approaches for modeling power flows are varied. Thus, the results indicate the importance of promoting investments in infrastructure projects that support pan-European power transmission. However, a wide range of possibilities exists to put this strategy into practice.},

Based on model results for numerous scenarios and sensitivity runs, we analyse key issues to explore feasibility, uncertainties, costs and priorities for climate-neutrality strategy. We suggest that a sustainable climate-neutral energy system in the EU is feasible using known technologies. We emphasise that the EU's climate and energy package for 2030 currently in legislation is not sufficient to ensure climate neutrality by 2050. We characterise as of ``no-regret'' options promoting energy efficiency, renewables and electrification where cost-effective. However, carbon neutrality also necessitates alternative options of ``disruptive'' nature. Technologies supporting the disruptive options are not yet mature in industry. High uncertainty surrounds their learning potential. Their deployment heavily depends on policies facilitating investment. The system analysis based on the model illustrates the importance of sectoral integration. We argue that hydrogen, and to a certain extent synthetic carbon-neutral hydrocarbons, are critical elements among the disruptive options.},

  abstract = {Electrical energy storage (EES) is a promising flexibility source for prospective low-carbon energy systems. In the last couple of years, many studies for EES capacity planning have been produced. However, these resulted in a very broad range of power and energy capacity requirements for storage, making it difficult for policymakers to identify clear storage planning recommendations. Therefore, we studied 17 recent storage expansion studies pertinent to the U.S., Europe, and Germany. We then systemized the storage requirement per variable renewable energy (VRE) share and generation technology. Our synthesis reveals that with increasing VRE shares, the EES power capacity increases linearly; and the energy capacity, exponentially. Further, by analyzing the outliers, the EES energy requirements can be at least halved. It becomes clear that grids dominated by photovoltaic energy call for more EES, while large shares of wind rely more on transmission capacity. Taking into account the energy mix clarifies\textemdash to a large degree\textemdash the apparent conflict of the storage requirements between the existing studies. Finally, there might exist a negative bias towards storage because transmission costs are frequently optimistic (by neglecting execution delays and social opposition) and storage can cope with uncertainties, but these issues are rarely acknowledged in the planning process.},

The incorporation of the dynamic line rating of overhead feeders can potentially improve the system security when providing economical and technical benefits for the microgrid. The proposed framework takes into account a realistic formulation to minimize the total microgrid costs in both grid-connected and multi-period islanded modes. Also, a stochastic framework based on unscented transform (UT) is proposed to model the uncertainties associated with renewable energy sources (RESs) output power, market energy price, load demand as well as the weather uncertain parameters such as solar radiation, wind speed, and ambient temperature. Due to the high nonlinearity and complexity of the proposed problem, an efficient optimization algorithm based on collective decision optimization algorithm (CDOA) is proposed. A new two-stage modification method is also developed to improve the algorithm search ability and avoid premature convergence. The proposed problem is examined on the IEEE 32-bus microgrid test system. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed model and verify its economic and reliability merits.},

  abstract = {Energy-economy optimization models \textendash{} encoded with a set of structured, self-consistent assumptions and decision rules \textendash{} have emerged as a key tool for the analysis of energy and climate policy at the national and international scale. Given the expansive system boundaries and multi-decadal timescales involved, addressing future uncertainty in these models is a critical challenge. The approach taken by many modelers is to build larger models with greater complexity to deal with structural uncertainty, and run a few highly detailed scenarios under different input assumptions to address parametric uncertainty. The result is often large and inflexible models used to conduct analysis that offers little insight. This paper introduces a technique borrowed from the operations research literature called modeling to generate alternatives (MGA) as a way to flex energy models and systematically explore the feasible, near-optimal solution space in order to develop alternatives that are maximally different in decision space but perform well with regard to the modeled objectives. The resultant MGA alternatives serve a useful role by challenging preconceptions and highlighting plausible alternative futures. A simple, conceptual model of the U.S. electric sector is presented to demonstrate the utility of MGA as an energy modeling technique.},

  abstract = {Power flow models are fundamental to power systems analyses ranging from short-term market clearing and voltage stability studies to long-term planning. Due to the nonlinear nature of the AC power flow equations and the associated computational challenges, linearized approximations (like the DC power flow) have been widely used to solve these problems in a computationally tractable manner. The linearized approximations have been justified using traditional engineering assumptions that under ``normal'' operating conditions, voltage magnitudes do not significantly deviate from nominal values and phase differences are ``small''. However, there is only limited work on rigorously quantifying when it is safe to use these linearized approximations. In this paper, we propose an algorithm capable of computing rigorous bounds on the approximation error in the DC power flow (and, in future extensions, more general linearized approximations) using convex relaxation techniques. Given a set of operational constraints (limits on the voltage magnitudes, phase angle differences, and power injections), the algorithm determines an upper bound on the difference in injections at each bus computed by the AC and DC power flow power flow models within this domain. We test our approach on several IEEE benchmark networks. Our experimental results show that the bounds are reasonably tight (i.e., there are points within the domain of interest that are close to achieving the bound) over a range of operating conditions.},

However, deployment is lagging far behind estimates of what is required. We demonstrate an opportunity to significantly expand CCUS in the United States in the near-term, spurred by new financial incentives enacted in February 2018, by targeting the lowest-cost capture opportunities and by deploying only commercially proven technologies. The carbon dioxide pipeline transport network would serve near-term oil industry demand for carbon dioxide while also connecting multiple prospective long-term dedicated geological storage resources. This would be a flexible long-term infrastructure asset for carbon management in the United States that would enable and accelerate future CCUS deployment.           ,              In February 2018, the United States enacted significant financial incentives for carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) that will make capture from the lowest-capture-cost sources economically viable. The largest existing low-capture-cost opportunity is from ethanol fermentation at biorefineries in the Midwest. An impediment to deployment of carbon capture at ethanol biorefineries is that most are not close to enhanced oil recovery (EOR) fields or other suitable geological formations in which the carbon dioxide could be stored. Therefore, we analyze the viability of a pipeline network to transport carbon dioxide from Midwest ethanol biorefineries to the Permian Basin in Texas, which has the greatest current carbon dioxide demand for EOR and large potential for expansion. We estimate capture and transport costs and perform economic analysis for networks under three pipeline financing scenarios representing different combinations of commercial and government finance. Without government finance, we find that a network earning commercial rates of return would not be viable. With 50\% government financing for pipelines, 19 million tons of carbon dioxide per year could be captured and transported profitably. Thirty million tons per year could be captured with full government pipeline financing, which would double global anthropogenic carbon capture and increase the United States' carbon dioxide EOR industry by 50\%. Such a development would face challenges, including coordination between governments and industries, pressing timelines, and policy uncertainties, but is not unprecedented. This represents an opportunity to considerably increase CCUS in the near-term and develop long-term transport infrastructure facilitating future growth.},

This work presents a multi-period spatially explicit least cost optimisation model of an integrated CO2 capture, transportation and storage infrastructure. The model is showcased through a case study focusing on the future UK CCS infrastructure. The solution demonstrates the investment requirement and operational strategy for all components of the chain at each phase and, hence, shows how the system evolves through four time periods up to year 2050.

Scaling is the most common preconditioning technique utilized in linear optimization solvers, and is designed to improve the conditioning of the constraint matrix and decrease the computational effort for solution. Most importantly, scaling provides a relative point of reference for absolute tolerances. For instance, absolute tolerances are used in the simplex algorithm to determine when a reduced cost is considered to be nonnegative. Existing techniques for obtaining scaling factors for linear systems are investigated herein. With a focus on the impact of these techniques on the performance of the simplex method, we analyze the results obtained from over half a billion simplex computations with CPLEX, MINOS and GLPK, including the computation of the condition number at every iteration. Some of the scaling techniques studied are computationally more expensive than others. For the Netlib and Kennington problems considered herein, it is found that on average no scaling technique outperforms the simplest technique (equilibration) despite the added complexity and computational cost.},

  abstract = {The need for flexibility in power system operation gradually increases regarding more renewable energy integration, load growth, etc., and the system operators already invest in this manner to enhance the power system operation. Besides, the power system has thermally sensitive assets such as lines, transformers, etc. that are normally operated under highly conservative static ratings. There is a growing trend in this regard to use the actual capacity of such assets dynamically under varying operating conditions leading to a dynamic thermal rating concept which is referred as dynamic line rating (DLR) approach specifically for lines. This study provides a comprehensive overview of existing perspectives on DLR and combination with other flexibility options from an operational point of view. Apart from the existing review studies more focused on implementation category of DLR concept, the concentration on more operational stage from the power system operation point of view leads the difference of this study compared to the mentioned studies. A categorization of the DLR implementation for either being sole or combined usage as a flexibility option is further realized. Besides, a geographically categorized analysis on existing practical evidence on DLR concept and implementations is also presented in this study.},

  abstract = {Hydrogen can be key in the energy system transition. We investigate the role of offshore hydrogen generation in a future integrated energy system, and its interaction with other system elements. By performing energy system optimisation in a model application of the Northern-central European energy system and the North Sea offshore grid towards 2050, we find that offshore hydrogen generation may likely only play a limited role, and that offshore wind energy has higher value when sent to shore in the form of electricity. Forcing all hydrogen generation offshore would lead to increased energy system costs (9-28 be 2016/year by 2045). Under the assumed scenario conditions, hydrogen generation - both onshore and offshore - follows solar PV generation patterns. Combined with hydrogen storage, this is the most cost-effective solution to satisfy future hydrogen demand. Overall, we find that the role of future offshore hydrogen generation should not simply be derived from minimizing costs for the offshore sub-system, but by also considering the value that such generation would create for the whole integrated energy system. Based on our results, a stronger political effort to promote the integration of offshore wind in onshore energy markets via electrical connection is called for.},

Although they require extensive infrastructure investments, they open up for the exploitation of additional resources and may be important to provide for part of the increasing electricity demand driven by sector coupling. This paper quantifies the socio-economic value of offshore grids and identifies their major drivers, performing energy system optimization in a model application of the Northern-central European energy system and the North Sea offshore grid towards 2050. The increasing wake loss with the size of hub-connected wind farms is integrated in the modelling. We find that without sector coupling no offshore grid may develop, and that the higher the level of sector coupling, the higher the value of offshore grids. Considering the influence of increasing wake losses with the size of hub-connected wind farms is especially relevant with higher level of sector coupling, leading to a more spread distribution of hub-connected wind farms, and to an improved representation of the available wind generation in the hubs. Therefore, it can be strongly stated that offshore grid infrastructure development should not be discussed as a separate political topic, but seen in connection to sector coupling.},

  abstract = {\textemdash{} The European Union is pushing to achieve a sustainable, competitive and secure energy supply in Europe. This has translated into significant long-term renewable energy targets towards 2050, and the ambition to improve the European grid. A large share of this development is expected to occur in the North Sea. This paper investigates which transmission architecture is the most beneficial to integrate large shares of renewable energy in the North Sea region, and the consequences of the planning horizon when planning such a system towards 2050 are analysed. This is achieved by performing investment optimisation of generation and transmission for different scenarios. It is found that: 1) an integrated offshore grid configuration planned over a long planning horizon leads to cost minimization; 2) the grid topology is not likely to influence the penetration of variable renewable energy, but it will affect the contribution of each variable renewable energy type and the system costs; and 3) not taking the future into account when developing the energy system is likely to lead to a more expensive system. These results remark the importance of long-term planning horizon for energy systems and grid expansion and calls for a political focus on planning and international cooperation.},

  abstract = {Abstract   Carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) is considered an important CO2 mitigation strategy to support and compliment carbon capture and storage (CCS) objectives for the abatement and sequestration of CO2. It represents various pathways that utilise CO2 as a feedstock in process systems or otherwise for the generation of value-added commodities. The CO2 used can be captured from different sources including power plants and industrial activities via several existing carbon capture and separation technologies that ensure a pure and safe CO2 supply. CCU pathways are mainly divided into five wide-ranging categories: CO2 conversion to chemicals and fuels, mineral carbonation, enhanced oil recovery, biological conversion, and direct CO2 utilisation. This study reviews the main CCU pathways and highlights their intra-sectoral and inter-sectoral opportunities within the energy water and food (EWF) systems, which is an important resource management concept. It also discusses the global status of CCU operational projects, research and development efforts directed toward CCU deployment, and important decision-making directions when integrating CCU with the EWF nexus. This review highlights that CCU pathways provide several cross-sectoral opportunities within the EWF sectors, by allaying resource competition between sectors and proposing co/tri-integrated solutions for securing EWF resources. Future efforts in this regard should be directed towards studying the EWF nexus within CCU routes in a comprehensive, quantitative, and holistic approach to identify and measure all trade-offs and synergies within EWF sectors, and to optimise CCU supply chains.},

Due to growing EU ambitions for the deployment of large offshore wind farm projects (OWF), as part of the 2050 renewable energy roadmap, there is a key need for a holistic understanding of OWF potential impacts on the marine ecosystem. We propose a holistic Cumulative Effect Assessment methodology, applied using a geo-spatial open-source software, to assess impacts of OWF related pressures on selected seabed habitats, fish, seabird and mammal species. We take into account pressures specific to the three OWF development phases, spanning 1999\textendash 2050, for the entire North Sea basin. Our results underline 2022 as the peak year of cumulative impacts for the approved OWFs, followed by a considerable increase in potential impacts of the planned 212GWs, by 2050. The spatio-temporal analysis of the OWF environmental impacts presents the shift between highly impacted areas over the studied timeline and distinguishes between concentrated areas of high impacts (S\textendash E of UK) and dispersed areas of high impacts (Germany). Our results can inform decision-makers and the OWF industry in a joint effort to mitigate the environmental impacts of future large OWF developments.},

  abstract = {Import and export of fossil energy carriers are cornerstones of energy systems world-wide. If energy systems are to become climate neutral and sustainable, fossil carriers need to be substituted with carbon neutral alternatives or electrified if possible. We investigate synthetic chemical energy carriers, hydrogen, methane, methanol, ammonia and Fischer-Tropsch fuels, produced using electricity from renewable energy sourceses as fossil substitutes. Renewable energy sourceses potentials are obtained from GIS-analysis and hourly resolved time-series are derived using reanalysis weather data. We model the sourcing of feedstock chemicals, synthesis and transport along nine different energy supply chains to Germany. and compare import options for seven locations around the world against each other and with domestically sourced alternatives on the basis of their respective cost per unit of hydrogen and energy delivered. We find that for each type of chemical energy carrier an import option with lower costs compared to domestic production in Germany exists. The lowest cost import options for energy and hydrogen are by hydrogen pipeline from Denmark, Spain and Western Asia and North Africa at 40.6 to 46.8 EUR per MWh (LHV) (1.4 to 1.6 EUR per kg H2) in 2050 assuming 5\% p.a. capital cost. For complex energy carriers like methane, ammonia, methanol or Fischer-Tropsch fuel, imports from Argentina by ship to Germany are attractive even compared to closer European Union or Western Asia and North Africa exporters. For meeting hydrogen demand, direct hydrogen imports are more attractive than indirect routes using methane, methanol or ammoniaimports and subsequent decomposition to hydrogen because of high capital investment costs and energetic losses of the indirect routes. We make our model and data available under open licenses for adaptation and reuse.},

  abstract = {Within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), ECMWF is producing the ERA5 reanalysis which, once completed, will embody a detailed record of the global atmosphere, land surface and ocean waves from 1950 onwards. This new reanalysis replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis (spanning 1979 onwards) which was started in 2006. ERA5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) Cy41r2 which was operational in 2016. ERA5 thus benefits from a decade of developments in model physics, core dynamics and data assimilation. In addition to a significantly enhanced horizontal resolution of 31 km, compared to 80 km for ERA-Interim, ERA5 has hourly output throughout, and an uncertainty estimate from an ensemble (3-hourly at half the horizontal resolution). This paper describes the general set-up of ERA5, as well as a basic evaluation of characteristics and performance, with a focus on the dataset from 1979 onwards which is currently publicly available. Re-forecasts from ERA5 analyses show a gain of up to one day in skill with respect to ERA-Interim. Comparison with radiosonde and PILOT data prior to assimilation shows an improved fit for temperature, wind and humidity in the troposphere, but not the stratosphere. A comparison with independent buoy data shows a much improved fit for ocean wave height. The uncertainty estimate reflects the evolution of the observing systems used in ERA5. The enhanced temporal and spatial resolution allows for a detailed evolution of weather systems. For precipitation, global-mean correlation with monthly-mean GPCP data is increased from 67\% to 77\%. In general, low-frequency variability is found to be well represented and from 10 hPa downwards general patterns of anomalies in temperature match those from the ERA-Interim, MERRA-2 and JRA-55 reanalyses.},

The technical potentials for renewable energies are a key input in models of this kind. In this context, it is important to ensure transparency in the assumptions: making available the underlying data to the public is thus an important step that can also further contribute to a scientific and transparent debate. This report is the first in a series, and addresses the quantification of current and future biomass potentials for energy. As already identified in the 2011 European Commission's Communication Energy roadmap 2050, biomass is expected to play a key role in strengthening the Energy Union pillars by diversifying the energy supply, increasing the energy internal market, decarbonising the economy and boosting competitiveness. Estimating the technical potentials available in EU countries using state of the art methodologies and updated data is important to fully understand the implications of an increased used of biomass for energy. Acknowledging this relevance, much work has been carried to characterise and quantify biomass resources. Building on the initial effort from the European Environment Agency, followed by key projects like BEE and Biomass Futures, this report presents the results of extending and improving current methodologies and estimation to respond to energy system modelling needs.},

  abstract = {Europe's offshore wind capacity is increasing rapidly, with larger turbines installed further from shore. TenneT proposed an innovative concept, the North Sea Wind Power Hub, in which several farms are connected to an artificial island which has interconnection to surrounding countries. This aims to reduce overall costs, but studies have so far evaluated hypothetical designs rather than the specific system operators' proposal, and focused primarily on construction costs rather than ongoing system-wide impacts. Here we develop a bottom-up capital cost estimate to compare the Power Hub with conventional point-to-point connection for offshore wind farms. We quantify its consequential impacts on regional electricity prices, the value of wind generation, fossil fuel generation and carbon emissions in 2030 using a pan-European electricity market model. We find that the Power Hub is cheaper if more than 10 GW of wind is built, as the avoided cost of multiple converter platforms offsets the cost of building an artificial island. It has profound impacts on electricity markets across Europe, especially in Britain and Ireland if they gain more interconnection to continental Europe. This impacts the economic viability of wind and gas power stations particularly, and saves 10Mt CO2 per year through reduced curtailment.},

As a consequence, transmission lines may become constrained. To accommodate load growth or distributed generation connections, one option is to operate existing transmission facilities up to their actual physical capacity rather than a conservative estimate of line capacity. Dynamic thermal rating of transmission lines provides actual current-carrying capacity of overhead lines based on real-time operating conditions. Dynamic Thermal Line Rating (DTLR) approaches vary significantly from one study to another in implementation, objectives and outcomes. Existing literature has presented several methodologies for DTLR adoption. This paper provides a comprehensive study of the literature on DTLR. It presents a survey and evaluation of various DTLR technologies, DTLR equipment, challenges with DTLR deployment, real world applications, and future approaches to DTLR implementation. The presented work is organized to allow a reader to understand and compare various DTLR approaches.},

Optimal transmission and generation investments are modelled in the region towards 2050. A project-based scenario, where each offshore wind power plant is connected individually, is first analysed. Then, an integrated offshore grid is modelled to investigate the viability of connecting future transmission and offshore wind generation investments. These two scenarios are then compared. It is shown that going towards an integrated solution can increase offshore wind investments by several GWs, with Germany seeing the biggest difference between the two scenarios. It is shown that the integrated solution leads to overall cost minimisation and shows somewhat higher variable renewable energy generation by 2050 compared to the project-based scenario.},

Such factors pose considerable stress on the economical and secure operation of power systems and the accommodation of large-scale renewable energies. However, under the smart grid circumstance, some cutting-edge transmission technologies can bring potential cost-effective solutions to leverage the potential capacity of existing transmission infrastructures. Such technologies can help the utilities to deal with the rapid change of operating conditions of the power system in a more flexible manner. For example, the network topology optimization (NTO) technology can change the transmission topology based on the operating conditions, which increases the flexibility of the transmission system. Dynamic thermal rating (DTR) can evaluate the maximum transmission capacity of transmission lines dynamically according to the weather condition parameters around the conductor. These two cost-effective technologies are promising in improving the congestion mitigation performance and can contribute to the efficient utilization of transmission network-so they will bring potential economic and reliability benefits. This paper incorporates NTO and DTR in the network-constrained unit commitment (NCUC) framework to study their synergistic effect on the power system day-ahead schedule. Case studies are performed on a modified RTS-79 system. The numerical results verify that the coordination of NTO and DTR may help decrease the generation cost and wind power curtailment.},

  abstract = {Designing highly renewable power systems involves a number of contested decisions, such as where to locate generation and transmission capacity. Yet, it is common to use a single result from a cost-minimizing energy system model to inform planning. This neglects many more alternative results, which might, for example, avoid problematic concentrations of technology capacity in any one region. To explore such alternatives, we develop a method to generate spatially explicit, practically optimal results (SPORES). Applying SPORES to Italy, we find that only photovoltaic and storage technologies are vital components for decarbonizing the power system by 2050; other decisions, such as locating wind power, allow flexibility of choice. Most alternative configurations are insensitive to cost and demand uncertainty, while dealing with adverse weather requires excess renewable generation and storage capacities. For policymakers, the approach can provide spatially detailed power system transformation options that enable decisions that are socially and politically acceptable.},

  abstract = {Over the last few decades, there has been a renewed interest in the offshore wind sector. In particular, floating wind turbines represent the next frontier in the wind power industry. Currently, only research prototypes exist, and few studies are available on their possible investment cost. Therefore, a cost assessment for this technology is necessary to ascertain whether it is economically sustainable. This paper develops a life cycle cost model for floating offshore wind farms, bringing together the most up-to-date data and parametric equations from databases and literature. The cost model considers the key parameters of the wind power economy, namely CAPEX, OPEX, DECEX and LCOE. The proposed model should be helpful for future decision-making, as the wind energy industry is in constant evolution. An application to an offshore floating wind farms is also carried out, in which the three main types of floaters are considered, namely the Semi-Submersible Platform, the Spar Buoy and the Tension Leg Platform. An average LCOE of 9.74 c/kWh was found, at the lower bound of the typical range applying to fixed base offshore wind farms, and higher than typical values applying to onshore wind farms.},

However, carbon emissions of CHP challenge the pollution and economic optimization of integrated energy system (IES). To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel model and optimal dispatch for CHP with power-to-gas (P2G) and carbon capture system (CCS), which solves the problems of the carbon source required for P2G and the CHP's carbon emissions by the optimal dispatch in IES. The model takes the CHP, P2G, and CCS as a whole system. The operation rule of the model is developed, and its coupling characteristics of electric power, heat power, gas power and carbon are analyzed. Correspondingly, the optimization strategy of IES considers the proposed model and carbon trading mechanism. The optimal dispatch model of IES is established and solved by YALMIP, and GUROBI. Our method is verified by simulation. Compared with other conventional models, the accommodation capacity of renewable energy with the proposed method is enhanced, and the carbon emissions and operating costs of IES are also reduced.},

This effort will require careful and comprehensive planning to ensure that capture locations, storage sites, and the dedicated CO2 distribution pipelines are selected in a robust and cost-effective manner. Introduced in 2009, SimCCS is an optimization model for integrated system design that enables researchers, stakeholders, and policy makers to design CCS infrastructure networks. SimCCS2.0 is a complete, ground-up redesign that is now a portable software package, useable and shareable by the CCS research, industrial, policy, and public communities. SimCCS2.0 integrates multiple new capabilities including a refined optimization model, novel candidate network generation techniques, and optional integration with high-performance computing platforms. Accessing user-provided CO2 source, sink, and transportation data, SimCCS2.0 creates candidate transportation routes and formalizes an optimization problem that determines the most cost-effective CCS system design. This optimization problem is then solved either through a high-performance computing interface, or through third-party software on a local desktop computing platform. Finally, SimCCS2.0 employs an open-access geographic information system framework to enable analysis and visualization capabilities. SimCCS2.0 is written in Java and is publicly available via GitHub to encourage collaboration, modification, and community development.},

Such energy systems will be needed to mitigate the negative impacts of economic development based on the use of fossil fuels, but will rely on variable renewable energy resources. As two-thirds of global greenhouse gas emissions can be attributed to fossil fuel combustion, decarbonization of energy systems is imperative for combating the climate change. Integrating future energy systems with CO2 capture and utilization technologies can contribute to deep decarbonization. As these technologies can be operated flexibly, they can be used to balance the grid to allow for high levels of variable renewable energy in the power mix. The captured CO2 can be either utilized as a feedstock for various value-added applications in the chemical industry and related sectors such as the food and beverage industries. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art literature on CO2 capture and utilization technologies, with an emphasis on their potential integration into a low-carbon, high-renewables penetration grid. The potential market size for CO2 as raw material is also elaborated and discussed. The review paper provides an insight to the development and the technological needs of different energy system sectors, as well the limitations, challenges and research gaps to the integration of the variable renewable energy sources and flexible carbon capture and utilization technologies.},

  abstract = {The distribution of renewable energy is now a reality in power distribution grids. This type of energy demands a new and effective electrical infrastructure to manage its intermittency. A dynamic line rating system provides an alternative for new assets with a large capital investment. Dynamic line rating studies and projects have revealed several issues that need to be solved to create safe and accurate systems. One of the major challenges is finding the best monitoring point. Because the ampacity changes along the overhead line, the objective of this study was to develop a methodology to calculate the distributed ampacity along the line using digital elevation and wind propagation models. Finally, an example of this methodology was applied to two real distribution lines: a short line and long line. A comparison between the new methodology and the current operation methodologies found that the point with the least cooling along the line differed depending on the wind direction. Thus, the ampacity could be overestimated by the commonly used dynamic line rating systems. Moreover, the proposed Simulated Distributed Wind Estimation (SWDE) is an economical alternative to a distributed monitoring system.},

  abstract = {The total renewable wind energy capacity of Spain currently accounts for more than 20\% of the total installed energy capacity, which makes integration into the grid challenging for wind farm owners as well as Distribution System Operator (DSO). Electrical companies require new techniques to integrate renewable energies safety and with low investment costs. Dynamic line rating (DLR) is one of these techniques, and is used by DSOs to maximise the capacity of existing infrastructure. This paper presents a successful case of DLR application by a DSO over several years to reduce the time that wind farms were out of service due to an excess of electrical energy generated. Over the period from January 2015 to September 2018, the application of the DLR technique prevented 4,100 hours of out-of-service time, increasing the energy supplied by the wind farms by 70.9 GWh and by extension saving 7,800 tons of CO2.},

This paper describes the InfraCCS model, which can determine the likely extent and cost of the optimal least-cost CO2 transport network at European scale for the period 2015\textendash 2050, with 2015 the earliest foreseeable starting date of the CCS projects co-funded by the European Energy Programme for Recovery (EEPR), and 2050 the EU's target date for 80\textendash 95\% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The computation is made possible by a number of methodological innovations compared to previous research, in particular: the use of k-means clustering to reduce the number of nodes in the network; the application of the Delaunay triangulation algorithm for pipeline pre-selection; and the introduction of a mathematically convenient yet realistic new pipeline costing model. The InfraCCS tool is applied to determine the optimal network corresponding to a CCS scenario that ensures near-complete decarbonisation of the European power sector. It is shown that the size of the CO2 network could range from 11,000 to 17,000km by 2050, requiring 16\textendash 36 billion euros investment, with the higher numbers corresponding to the case when onshore aquifers are excluded as potential CO2 storage sites. Since the model shows that by 2030 more than half of the EU Member States could be involved in cross-border CO2 transport, international coordination seems crucial for the development of an optimised trans-European CO2 transport network.},

We provide the proof of convergence for the proposed generalized algorithm considering long step size. We also provide the proof of convergence for the primal and dual sequence without the degeneracy assumption. This convergence result generalizes the original convergence result for the Affine Scaling methods and it gives us hints about the existence of a new family of methods. Then, we introduce a second algorithm to accelerate the convergence rate of the generalized algorithm by integrating a non-linear series transformation technique.

  abstract = {Background: Among the major players in German energy politics, a broad consensus exists that one important condition for the transition to renewable energies is to expand the electricity transmission grid. More than 7000 km of new or extended power routes are planned, generally as overhead lines. Mainly because of local protests, many projects, however, lag behind their original timetable. The protest initiatives are often supported by concerned municipalities and districts, environmental organizations, and scientists. This paper examines the most conflicted projects and inquires whether the protests are part of a social movement. Methods: The study aims for a better understanding of these protests. It therefore explores the opponents' action orientations and the relevant action fields. The main method is a comparative qualitative case study that is based on a document analysis. The latter was supported by quantitative considerations. Results: Whereas homogeneity in local and regional contexts predominates, across the regions, the protests often strongly diverge in respect to their dominant frames and action orientations. This occurs in a diverse structure of action fields. If the protests are strong and fundamentally oriented, the conflicts take place mainly in state field and discursive arenas. Conclusions: Although the grid extension protests share characteristics with the activities against war, discrimination, and nuclear power use, they are not a social movement in the narrow sense. Rather, they are a collection of single-point protests that occasionally transcend their own boundaries to take on a more coherent and unified character.},

  abstract = {With rising shares of renewables and the need to properly assess trade-offs between transmission, storage and sectoral integration as balancing options, building a bridge between energy system models and detailed power flow studies becomes increasingly important, but is computationally challenging. W compare approximations for two nonlinear phenomena, power flow and transmission losses, in linear capacity expansion problems that co-optimise investments in generation, storage and transmission infrastructure. We evaluate different flow representations discussing differences in investment decisions, nodal prices, the deviation of optimised flows and losses from simulated AC power flows, and the computational performance. By using the open European power system model PyPSA-Eur we obtain detailed and reproducible results aiming at facilitating the selection of a suitable power flow model. Given the differences in complexity, the optimal choice depends on the application, the user's available computational resources, and the level of spatial detail considered. Although the commonly used transport model can already identify key features of a cost-efficient system while being computationally performant, deficiencies under high loading conditions arise due to the lack of a physical grid representation. Moreover, disregarding transmission losses overestimates optimal grid expansion by 20\%. Adding a convex relaxation of quadratic losses with two or three tangents to the linearised power flow equations and accounting for changing line impedances as the network is reinforced suffices to represent power flows and losses adequately in design studies. We show that the obtained investment and dispatch decisions are then sufficiently physical to be used in more detailed nonlinear simulations of AC power flow in order to better assess their technical feasibility.},

  abstract = {Electricity transmission expansion has suffered many delays in Europe in recent decades, despite its importance for integrating renewable electricity into the energy system. A hydrogen network which reuses the existing fossil gas network would not only help supply demand for low-emission fuels, but could also help to balance variations in wind and solar energy across the continent and thus avoid power grid expansion. We pursue this idea by varying the allowed expansion of electricity and hydrogen grids in net-zero CO\$\_2\$ scenarios for a sector-coupled European energy system with high shares of renewables and self-sufficient supply. We cover the electricity, buildings, transport, agriculture, and industry sectors across 181 regions and model every third hour of a year. With this high spatio-temporal resolution, we can capture bottlenecks in transmission and the variability of demand and renewable supply. Our results show a consistent benefit of a pan-continental hydrogen backbone that connects high-yield regions with demand centers, synthetic fuel production and geological storage sites. Developing a hydrogen network reduces system costs by up to 6\%, with highest benefits when electricity grid reinforcements cannot be realised. Between 58\% and 66\% of this backbone could be built from repurposed natural gas pipelines. However, we find that hydrogen networks can only partially substitute for power grid expansion, and that both can achieve strongest cost savings of 12\% together.},

We apply the modeling-to-generate-alternatives (MGA) methodology to systematically explore the near-optimal feasible space of a completely renewable European electricity system model. While accounting for complex spatio-temporal patterns, we allow simultaneous capacity expansion of generation, storage and transmission infrastructure subject to linearized multi-period optimal power flow. Many similarly costly, but technologically diverse solutions exist. Already a cost deviation of 0.5\% offers a large range of possible investments. However, either offshore or onshore wind energy along with some hydrogen storage and transmission network reinforcement are essential to keep costs within 10\% of the optimum.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we develop a model to analyze the economics of carbon capture, transport, and storage (CCTS) in the wake of expected rising CO2 prices. We present a scalable mixed integer, multiperiod, welfare-optimizing network model for Europe, called CCTS-Mod. The model incorporates endogenous decisions on carbon capture, pipeline and storage investments, as well as capture, flow and injection quantities based on given costs, CO2 prices, storage capacities, and point source emissions. Given full information about future costs of CCTS-technology, and CO2 prices, the model determines a cost minimizing strategy on whether to purchase CO2 certificates, or to abate the CO2 through investments into a CCTS-chain on a site by site basis. We apply the model to analyze different scenarios for the deployment of CCTS in Europe, e.g., under high and low CO2 prices, respectively. We find that beyond CO2 prices of \texteuro 50 per t, CCTS can contribute to the decarbonization of Europe's industry sectors, as long as one assumes sufficient storage capacities (onshore and/or offshore). We find that CCTS is only viable for the power sector if the CO2 certificate price exceeds \texteuro 75 per t.},

  abstract = {The North Sea region, located in the Northwest of Europe, is expected to be a frontrunner in the European energy transition. This paper aims to analyse different optimal system configurations in order to meet net-zero emission targets in 2050. Overall, the paper presents two main contributions: first, we develop and introduce the IESA-NS model. The IESA-NS model is an optimization integrated energy system model written as a linear problem. The IESA-NS model optimizes the long-term investment planning and short-term operation of seven North Sea region countries (Belgium, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom). The model can optimize multiple years simultaneously, accounts for all the national GHG emissions and includes a thorough representation of all the sectors of the energy system. Second, we run several decarbonisation scenarios with net-zero emission targets in 2050. Relevant parameters varied to produce the scenarios include biomass availability, VRE potentials, low social acceptance of onshore VRE, ban of CCUS or mitigation targets in international transport and industry feedstock. Results show a large use of hydrogen when international transport emissions are considered in the targets (5.6 EJ to 7.3 EJ). Electrolysis is the preferred pathway for hydrogen production (up to 6.4 EJ), far ahead of natural gas reforming (up to 2.2 EJ). Allowing offshore interconnectors (e.g. meshed offshore grid between the Netherlands, Germany and the United Kingdom) permits to integrate larger amounts of offshore wind (122 GW to 191 GW of additional capacity compared to reference scenarios), while substantially increasing the cross-border interconnection capacities (up to 120 GW). All the biomass available is used in the scenarios across multiple end uses, including biofuel production (up to 3.5 EJ), high temperature heat (up to 2.5 EJ), feedstock for industry (up to 2 EJ), residential heat (up to 600 PJ) and power generation (up to 900 PJ). In general, most of the results justify the development of multinational energy system models, in which the spatial coverage lays between national and continental models.},

Currently, several floating turbine concepts are being designed and tested in small scale projects; in particular, one concept allows the turbine to move after installation. This article presents a novel layout optimization framework for wind farms composed of moveable floating turbines. The proposed framework uses an evolutionary optimization strategy in a nested configuration which simultaneously optimizes the anchoring locations and the wind turbine position within the mooring lines for each individual wind direction. The results show that maximum energy production is obtained when moveable wind turbines are deployed in an optimized layout. In conclusion, the framework represents a new design optimization tool for future offshore wind farms composed of moveable floating turbines.},

In this paper, we propose an optimization model that accounts for the inherent flexibility in line ratings of thermal restricted transmission lines. We determine, in a stochastic unit commitment framework, when and which line can and should adopt higher ratings (calculated based on anticipated weather conditions and loading) as part of the recourse actions. Such recourse decisions in the second stage models the capability of the transmission system to provide flexibility to mitigate the variability of renewable generation. Flexible line ratings in the recourse help improve first-stage commitment decisions. Numerical tests conducted on both IEEE 118 system and a network representing the Central European System demonstrate that with flexible line ratings recourse, the expected operation cost can be substantially reduced without degrading reliability.},

  abstract = {The European Union's ambition to achieve near-total decarbonization by 2050 suggests a large role for carbon capture and storage (CCS), requiring the transport (mostly by pipeline) of CO2 from source facilities to appropriate sites for geological storage. Here, a network modeling approach is used to test the scale, structure, and estimated costs of an integrated European CO2 transport network for different amounts of CCS deployment. Models are optimized with the sole objective of creating the least cost pipeline network that joins all sources to sufficient storage for a 25-year period of operation, and assume no restrictions on trans-boundary transport of CO2, or due to topographical constraints. Results show that extensive CO2 pipeline networks are required to deliver the CCS contribution to decarbonization. Sufficient storage is available but is distributed such that even for low levels of CCS deployment, both offshore storage and trans-boundary transport of CO2 are needed. Scenarios are run to test pipeline infrastructure requirements should onshore CO2 storage not be permitted, giving an estimated increase in CO2 transport infrastructure cost of 10\textendash 30\% (\texteuro 3\textendash 7 billion). Scenarios examining the effect of removing the more speculative storage potential in the Baltic, close to central and eastern European CO2 source clusters, reinforce the need to experimentally validate theoretical storage capacity estimates especially in the Baltic and North Sea.},

A condition for the application of hydrogen is a functioning logistic chain. However, researchers are still discussing the most efficient way to transport large hydrogen quantities. A promising option is to convert the existing natural gas infrastructure, but technical and economical evaluation and comparison of converted transportation networks are missing. This study presents a novel approach to develop hydrogen networks by applying the Steiner tree algorithm to derive candidates and evaluate their costs. This method uses the existing grid (brownfield) and is compared to a newly built grid (greenfield). The methodology is applied to the German gas grid and demand and supply scenarios covering the industry, heavy-duty transport, power, and heating sector, imports, and domestic production. Five brownfield candidates are compared to a greenfield candidate. The candidates differ by network length and pipeline diameters to consider the transported volume of hydrogen. The economic evaluation concludes that most brownfield candidates' cost is significantly lower than of the greenfield candidate. The candidates can serve as starting points for flow simulations and policymakers can estimate the cost based on the results.},

We develop scenarios for how public acceptance may constrain the diffusion of CCS, either by reducing the overall amount of installable CCS capacity or by delaying its introduction, and show with an integrated assessment model how the type of limitation in CCS acceptance can critically impact the development of all sectors in the overall energy system over time. We also demonstrate that a reduction or delay in CCS diffusion as a result of critical public opinion can have substantial energy system impacts that differ across not only the nature of acceptance profile but also the sector(s) in which limited public acceptance materializes. Applying a constraint to CCS deployment in both industry and the power sector simultaneously leads to an energy system that is fundamentally different from the one that emerges if the constraint is only applied to the power sector. Depending on how and where CCS diffusion is constrained, net additional annual energy system costs in 2050 can vary between -50 billion up to nearly 800 billon \$/yr.},

  abstract = {Europe's contribution to global warming will be determined by the cumulative emissions until climate neutrality is achieved. Here, we investigate alternative transition paths under different carbon budgets. We use PyPSA-Eur-Sec, an open model of the sector-coupled European energy system with high spatial and temporal resolution. All the paths entail similar technological transformations, but the timing of the scale-up of important technologies like electrolysis, carbon capture, and hydrogen network differs. Solar PV and onshore and offshore wind become the cornerstone of a net-zero energy system, enabling the decarbonization of other sectors via direct electrification (heat pumps and electric vehicles) or indirect electrification (using synthetic fuels). For a social cost of carbon (SCC) of 120V/tCO2, transition paths under 1.5 and 1.6 C budgets are, respectively, 8\% and 1\% more expensive than the 2 C budget because building assets earlier costs more. The 1.5 C budget is cost optimal if a SCC of at least 300V/tCO2 is considered.},

  abstract = {The concept of dynamic rating (DR) implies that the capacity of a component varies dynamically as a function of external parameters, while the rating traditionally is based on the worst-case. The value of DR thus lies in utilizing existing equipment to a greater extent. By implementing DR and correlating the new ratings with wind power generation, more generation can be implemented. The aim is hence to facilitate connection of renewable electricity production. This paper provides two main contributions: 1) a general dynamic line rating (DLR) calculation model on overhead lines; and 2) an economic optimization simulation model regarding wind power integration comparing DLR with more traditional approaches. These models can both be implemented together, but also separately. The DLR calculation model is easy to use by companies in daily operation where the dynamic line capacity is calculated as a function of static line capacity, wind speed, and ambient temperature. The DLR calculation model is furthermore compared with more comprehensive calculations that validate that the model is accurate enough. This paper also provides an application study where both proposed models are exemplified together and evaluated. Results from this study conclude that it is a significant economic potential of implementing DR within wind power integration.},

  abstract = {For this study, a spatially and temporally resolved optimization model was used to investigate and economically evaluate pathways for using surplus electricity to cover positive residual loads by means of different technologies to reconvert hydrogen into electricity. The associated technology pathways consist of electrolyzers, salt caverns, hydrogen pipelines, power cables, and various technologies for reconversion into electricity. The investigations were conducted based on an energy scenario for 2050 in which surplus electricity from northern Germany is available to cover the electricity grid load in the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW). A key finding of the pathway analysis is that NRW's electricity demand can be covered entirely by renewable energy sources in this scenario, which involves CO2 savings of 44.4 million tons of CO2/a in comparison to the positive residual load being covered from a conventional power plant fleet. The pathway involving CCGT (combined cycle gas turbines) as hydrogen reconversion option was identified as being the most cost effective (total investment: \texteuro{} 43.1 billion, electricity generation costs of reconversion: \texteuro{} 176/MWh). Large-scale hydrogen storage and reconversion as well as the use of the hydrogen infrastructure built for this purpose can make a meaningful contribution to the expansion of the electricity grid. However, for reasons of efficiency, substituting the electricity grid expansion entirely with hydrogen reconversion systems does not make sense from an economic standpoint. Furthermore, the hydrogen reconversion pathways evaluated, including large-scale storage, significantly contribute to the security of the energy supply and to secured power generation capacities.},

  abstract = {The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5\textdegree C points to the need for carbon neutrality by mid-century. Achieving this in the United States in only 30 years will be challenging, and practical pathways detailing the technologies, infrastructure, costs, and tradeoffs involved are needed. Modeling the entire U.S. energy and industrial system with new analysis tools that capture synergies not represented in sector-specific or integrated assessment models, we created multiple pathways to net zero and net negative CO2 emissions by 2050. They met all forecast U.S. energy needs at a net cost of 0.2\textendash 1.2\% of GDP in 2050, using only commercial or near-commercial technologies, and requiring no early retirement of existing infrastructure. Pathways with constraints on consumer behavior, land use, biomass use, and technology choices (e.g., no nuclear) met the target but at higher cost. All pathways employed four basic strategies: energy efficiency, decarbonized electricity, electrification, and carbon capture. Least-cost pathways were based on {$>$}80\% wind and solar electricity plus thermal generation for reliability. A 100\% renewable primary energy system was feasible but had higher cost and land use. We found multiple feasible options for supplying low-carbon fuels for non-electrifiable end uses in industry, freight, and aviation, which were not required in bulk until after 2035. In the next decade, the actions required in all pathways were similar: expand renewable capacity 3.5 fold, retire coal, maintain existing gas generating capacity, and increase electric vehicle and heat pump sales to {$>$}50\% of market share. This study provides a playbook for carbon neutrality policy with concrete near-term priorities.},
