  abstract = {This work presents a novel optimization framework for the optimal design of carbon capture, transport, and storage supply chains in terms of installation, sizing and operation of carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and transport technologies. The optimal design problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program that minimizes the total costs of the supply chains while complying with different emissions reduction pathways over a deployment time horizon of 25 years. All design decisions are time-dependent and are taken with a yearly resolution. Whereas the model is general, here its features are illustrated by designing optimal supply chains to decarbonize the Swiss waste-to-energy sector, for various emission reduction pathways, when up to two storage sites are considered, namely one in the North Sea assumed to be already available and a hypothetical one in Switzerland assumed to be possibly available in the future. Findings show that, unless a domestic storage site becomes available soon, the transport cost is the greatest contribution to the overall costs, followed by the capture cost, while the storage cost plays only a minor role. Pipelines are the most cost-effective mode of transport for large volumes of transported CO2, especially when considering multi-year time horizons for the planning of the supply chains. Ship and barge connections are competitive with pipeline connections, whereas rail and truck connections are cost-optimal only when considering shortsighted time horizons or small volumes of CO2 transported.},

  abstract = {There are two competing concepts for the integration of high shares of renewable energy: the coupling of electricity to other energy sectors, such as transport and heating, and the reinforcement of transmission networks. In this paper both sector coupling and continent-wide grid integration are considered in the model PyPSA-Eur-Sec-30, the first open, spatially-resolved, temporally-resolved and sector-coupled energy model of Europe. Using a simplified network with one node per country, the cost-optimal system is calculated for a 95\% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions compared to 1990, incorporating electricity, transport and heat demand. The demand-side management potential from battery electric vehicles (BEV), power-to-gas units (P2G) and long-term thermal energy storage (LTES) make a significant contribution to the smoothing of variability from wind and solar and to the reduction of total system costs. The cost-minimising integration of BEV pairs well with the daily variations of solar power, while P2G and LTES balance the synoptic and seasonal variations of demand and renewables. In all scenarios, an expansion of cross-border transmission reduces system costs, but the more tightly the energy sectors are coupled, the weaker the benefit of transmission becomes.},

  abstract = {Commercial-scale carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology will involve deploying infrastructure on a massive and costly scale. This effort will require careful and comprehensive planning to ensure that capture locations, storage sites, and the dedicated CO2 distribution pipelines are selected in a robust and cost-effective manner. Introduced in 2009, SimCCS is an optimization model for integrated system design that enables researchers, stakeholders, and policy makers to design CCS infrastructure networks. SimCCS2.0 is a complete, ground-up redesign that is now a portable software package, useable and shareable by the CCS research, industrial, policy, and public communities. SimCCS2.0 integrates multiple new capabilities including a refined optimization model, novel candidate network generation techniques, and optional integration with high-performance computing platforms. Accessing user-provided CO2 source, sink, and transportation data, SimCCS2.0 creates candidate transportation routes and formalizes an optimization problem that determines the most cost-effective CCS system design. This optimization problem is then solved either through a high-performance computing interface, or through third-party software on a local desktop computing platform. Finally, SimCCS2.0 employs an open-access geographic information system framework to enable analysis and visualization capabilities. SimCCS2.0 is written in Java and is publicly available via GitHub to encourage collaboration, modification, and community development.},

  abstract = {Electricity transmission expansion has suffered many delays in Europe in recent decades, despite its importance for integrating renewable electricity into the energy system. A hydrogen network which reuses the existing fossil gas network would not only help supply demand for low-emission fuels, but could also help to balance variations in wind and solar energy across the continent and thus avoid power grid expansion. We pursue this idea by varying the allowed expansion of electricity and hydrogen grids in net-zero CO\$\_2\$ scenarios for a sector-coupled European energy system with high shares of renewables and self-sufficient supply. We cover the electricity, buildings, transport, agriculture, and industry sectors across 181 regions and model every third hour of a year. With this high spatio-temporal resolution, we can capture bottlenecks in transmission and the variability of demand and renewable supply. Our results show a consistent benefit of a pan-continental hydrogen backbone that connects high-yield regions with demand centers, synthetic fuel production and geological storage sites. Developing a hydrogen network reduces system costs by up to 6\%, with highest benefits when electricity grid reinforcements cannot be realised. Between 58\% and 66\% of this backbone could be built from repurposed natural gas pipelines. However, we find that hydrogen networks can only partially substitute for power grid expansion, and that both can achieve strongest cost savings of 12\% together.},

  abstract = {A straightforward global layout of carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) is imperative for limiting global warming well below 2\,\textdegree C. Here, we propose a cost-effective strategy for matching carbon sources and sinks on a global scale. Results show 3,093 carbon clusters and 432 sinks in 85 countries and regions are selected to achieve 92\,GtCO2 mitigation by CCUS, 64\% of which will be sequestered into sedimentary basins for aquifer storage and 36\% will be used for CO2-EOR (enhanced oil recovery). Of the identified source\textendash sink matching, 80\% are distributed within 300\,km and are mainly located in China, the United States, the European Union, Russia and India. The total cost is \textasciitilde 0.12\% of global cumulative gross domestic product. Of countries with CO2-EOR, 75\% will turn into profitable at the oil price over US\$100 per barrel. These findings indicate our proposed layout is economically feasible. However, its implementation requires global collaboration on financial and technological transfer.},
